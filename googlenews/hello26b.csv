semiconductor,china,"New Semiconductor Technologies Driving Down Cost Of Electric Vehicle 
Batteries","By Hana Askren and Mark Andress,Until now, electric vehicle batteries suffered from being costly, large and inefficient. Gallium nitride (GaN) and silicon carbide (SiC) are two semiconductor technologies in the driver’s seat to change all that. ,Close-up of battery packs box in the the electric car.,The newer chemistries allow for smaller, more efficient semiconductors that can operate at higher voltages than traditional silicon wafers. Tesla’s decision to include SiC transistors in its Model 3 was seen as a big milestone for the industry. ,SiC first established itself at 1,200 volts, where it outcompetes silicon and GaN, and has moved down toward the 600 to 900 volt level to serve the EV market. GaN outcompetes silicon in the 200 to 900 volt level and is also establishing itself in the EV market. At these voltages, the technology can also be used in power electronics for solar power systems and industrial motor drives. ,With the automotive industry’s rapid pivot to electric vehicles, a slew of semiconductor startups are expected to be targeted by more-established players.,Among the most mature GaN startups are Ottawa, Ontario-based GaN Systems and El Segundo, California-based Navitas Semiconductor, whose , already have been identified in product “teardowns,” in which a device is dismantled to figure out who manufactures the parts. ,Other promising GaN startups include Ithaca, New York-based Odyssey Semiconductor and Israel’s VisIC Technologies, which are both developing high-voltage power switches and modules. El Segundo-based Efficient Power Conversion (EPC) and Goleta, California-based Transphorm, in which private equity firm KKR is an investor, are also notable GaN startups.,Meanwhile, Cree, the largest pure-play SiC company, , last year that it would invest $1 billion to expand manufacturing capacity at its Durham, North Carolina headquarters, as well to build a new fabrication facility in upstate New York. Other smaller SiC companies include Virginia-based GeneSiC Semiconductor, New Jersey-based United Silicon Carbide and New Hampshire-based GT Advanced Technologies.,Leading power semiconductor device players, which feature STMicroelectronics, Infineon Technologies, ON Semiconductor and Mitsubishi Electric, likely are all watching the upstarts. Some have already made acquisitions, as , in February 2019 when it bought Swedish SiC wafer manufacturer Norstel for $137.5 million. Other big players – such as Panasonic, ON Semiconductor, Texas Instruments and SanKen Electric – also have been developing GaN switching transistors. Expect some to switch gears with an acquisition to speed up that process, according to an industry investment banker and analyst. ,In addition to proven applications like EVs and solar panels, these devices are opening the door to whole new applications, said Craig Irwin, managing director and senior research analyst at Roth Capital, adding, “there’s a lot of blue sky out there – where else are these going to be used?” New companies are entering the market, taking on the R&D and startup risks, and could become targets once their products are established. ,There is “intense interest” in these companies for M&A and investment, and a scarcity of targets, Irwin added. Takeout valuations would have to be large in order to counter the opportunity of remaining independent and raising private capital, or pursuing an IPO.,We are a leading independent M&A media service with an unrivaled network of over 300 dedicated M&A journalists based in 65 locations across the Americas, Europe,We are a leading independent M&A media service with an unrivaled network of over 300 dedicated M&A journalists based in 65 locations across the Americas, Europe, Asia-Pacific, the Middle-East and Africa.

semiconductor,china,TSMC's Strong Earnings Emphasizes Semiconductor Trends,"Semiconductors have seen a resurgence back into growth as the cyclicality of the segment is turning in its favor. The recent rally in the semi space is related to the 5G rollout and the revival of hyperscaling. Q4 earnings are on the horizon, and semis are on deck.,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company aka TSMC TSM, kicked off earnings for chip makers on a positive note this morning. TSMC is the largest semiconductor foundry in the world, partnering with almost every major chipmaker, and can shed some light on what to expect from semi earnings moving forward. Following TSMC’s robust Q4 results propelled top semiconductor stocks in morning trading.,With the 5G rollout underway, it should come as no surprise that the most significant growth drivers for TSMC in 2019 were related. These drivers included smartphones (49% of sales) and Internet of Things (IoT), which saw a year-over-year topline appreciation of 12% and 33%, respectively.,TSMC’s 4th quarter revenue was driven by smartphone chips, and the rise of its 7nm chip (smallest in commercial use) has begun to push high-performance computing (data centers) demand. 7nm chip manufacturing is the largest revenue driver for this firm, and TSMC is now working on 5nm chips, which should be in commercial production by H2 of 2020 and will sizably enhance chips capabilities.,The ability to make 7nm and 5nm chips is going to drive the next wave of hyperscaling, which appears to have already started. Hyperscaling is a computing company’s ability to effectively scale with demand. These new chips will allow cloud computing and AI firms to achieve capabilities not yet seen. This should drive a substantial amount of demand for these types of chips.,TSMC’s largest customers include smartphone giants like Huawei and Apple as well as top chipmakers like AMD AMD, Nvidia NVDA, Broadcom AVGO, and Qualcomm QCOM. Below illustrate how these stocks have performed over the past 52-weeks.,As a whole, the semiconductor space has been pricing in forecasted growth for this year and next. The demand driven by 5G technology is propelling AVGO and QCOM. The resurgence of hyperscaling is driving AMD and NVDA. The question is whether investors and traders have traded these stocks above their intrinsic value or if they have more room to run.,The two hyperscaling plays, AMD and NVDA, are trading at very rich multiples. It wouldn’t take much for these stocks topple over. Forward guidance is going to be crucial when these companies report in the coming weeks, as this will likely dictate the price action.,AVGO and QCOM are trading at much more reasonable valuations when compared to the broader segment, but are both anticipating to see negative year-over-year EPS change. Despite the negative earnings, there is still a lot of potential in these equities. Change in management guidance will again be critical for a directional move on these stocks.,Below are Zacks Consensus estimates on the key semi earnings in the coming weeks.,TSMC is the backbone of chip-making as it manufactures roughly 50% of semiconductors globally.

semiconductor,china,Exclusive: Washington pressures TSMC to make chips in US,"TAIPEI -- Washington has upped the pressure on , to produce its military-use chips in the U.S., in order to ensure that the world's biggest contract chipmaker can manufacture the high-security components free from potential Chinese interference, sources have told the Nikkei Asian Review.,TSMC, which makes computer chips used in American F-35 fighter jets and serves as a key supplier to Apple as well as Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei Technologies, has sidestepped , before.,But as Beijing and Washington jostle for technological and military supremacy, the company faces growing American pressure to make a firm decision about producing in the U.S. or offering another security-compatible solution before the U.S. presidential election in November.,Though Washington and Beijing are due to sign the first phase of a trade deal this week, easing two years of bilateral tensions, the pressure on TSMC shows that global tech supply chains are still decoupling as security hawks in the U.S. administration continue to press the White House to act over China's technological and military buildup.,""The U.S. government wants chips that go into military projects to be built on American soil,"" a senior Taiwanese government official, who was briefed about Washington's approaches to TSMC given the company's strategic and technological importance, told Nikkei. ""That's for national security concerns, and they [the U.S.] don't plan to back off on that."",TSMC, which holds a 50% share of the world's chip foundry business, supplies computer chips to Huawei and American tech giants such as Google, Qualcomm and Intel. The Taiwanese company also supplies high-performance chips for U.S. military suppliers such as Xilinx, which in turn makes components for American F-35 fighter jets and satellites.,Washington has made keeping Chinese technology and surveillance at bay a global priority. TSMC, as a major U.S. and Chinese chip supplier, has often found itself in the middle of the technology standoff as a result. In addition to the F-35 jets, TSMC makes U.S. Defense Department-approved ""military grade"" chips that may be used by some of its other American clients for classified military purposes.,Industry sources said American officials talked with TSMC ""several times"" ahead of last weekend's election in Taiwan, which saw China-skeptic President Tsai Ing-wen reelected in an outcome that Beijing decried but that U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo hailed as ""a force for good in the world."",Ian Steff, assistant secretary of the U.S. Commerce Department, last month made his third visit to Taiwan during 2019, where he met with TSMC founder Morris Chang and Chairman Mark Liu at a private reception, one executive source told Nikkei.,""We've noticed that many U.S. tech executives and government officials are concerned about their country's dependence on TSMC and the security of their defense industry's supply chains,"" said Su Tze-yun, director of Taiwan's Institute for National Defense and Security Research.,""That's why the U.S. constantly hopes that TSMC could stand with them to make chips somewhere else other than just Taiwan, which they think is not completely safe because China has not ruled out the possibility of taking control of the island by force,"" the director said.,Su was referring to Chinese President Xi Jinping, who repeated last year that Beijing would not rule out using force to expedite unification between mainland China and Taiwan, which it views as a wayward province.,Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang reiterated Beijing's stance this week, saying that he hoped the international community would continue to ""support the just cause of Chinese people to oppose the secessionist activities for 'Taiwan independence' and realize national reunification."",The Pentagon has long worried about such risks and last year contacted several TSMC customers, warning them about the security implications of offshoring production to a Taiwanese company. TSMC's work for Huawei may add an extra perceived level of risk.,Industry sources said they expect the U.S. administration to increase restrictions this year on the use of U.S. technology by Huawei, which Washington views as a security threat. Huawei has consistently denied the allegations.,Huawei, which last year asked TSMC to transfer more chip production to its $3 billion advanced plant in Nanjing that started production in 2018, accounts for 10% of TSMC's revenue. Chinese clients in total provide around 20%.,Some China hawks in President Donald Trump's administration, which this week urged the U.K. to exclude Huawei from Britain's 5G network, may even be seeking a near-outright ban on all U.S. technology sales to China, though no consensus exists on the issue in the White House, The Wall Street Journal , on Wednesday.  ,""Before the next U.S. presidential election, TSMC will have to respond further to this urgent request from its U.S. customers under pressure from the American government to make sure that sensitive chips will either be more secure or, better, that such chips are produced on American soil,"" another source familiar with TSMC's situation said.,TSMC said repeatedly last year that it would not rule out building or buying a high-specification plant in the U.S. to assuage such concerns, though the company also cautioned that such a move would need to be weighed carefully given the higher operating costs involved.,""We have never ruled out building or acquiring a fab [semiconductor fabrication plant] in the United States, but currently there is no concrete plan,"" TSMC reiterated when Nikkei sought comment for this article.,TSMC's closest American rival, contract chipmaker Globalfoundries, has one advanced chip facility in New York. But the company, owned by the Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund, is considered unable to meet U.S. demands for the latest chip technologies needed in advanced applications, such as military uses.,That has left TSMC to walk a delicate line between its , especially given security concerns about the risk of computer chips being compromised in a conflict via so-called back doors that might cause entire networks to be shut down.,""A lot of work lies ahead to effectively adopt a holistic, ""zero-trust"" approach to security in microelectronics,"" Lisa Porter, the U.S. deputy undersecretary of defense for research and engineering, wrote last September in a Defense Department article about electronic security.,The U.S. accounts for 60% of TSMC's sales, but the company operates only its subsidiary WaferTech there, producing chips for mature technologies. The majority of TSMC's production is in Taiwan. ,""As the world becomes more chaotic, TSMC is emerging as a strategic territory that all geopolitical forces aim to secure,"" Chang, the company founder, told reporters and employees in November.,Sign up to our newsletters to get our best stories delivered straight to your inbox.,Discover the all new ,Nikkei Asia app,Discover the all new ,Nikkei Asia app,Stay ahead with our ,;, the most dynamic market in the world.,Stay ahead with ,Get , within Asia itself.,Get , within Asia itself.,

            TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — South Korea can hardly compete with Taiwan in semiconductor manufacturing despite the ambitious move by Samsung Electronics to put a 3-nanometer semiconductor node into commercial production, said Taiwan’s top tech official.,
            Taiwan’s semiconductor industry had an annual output valued at NT$2.6 trillion (US$867 billion) in 2019, said Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) Minister Chen Liang-gee (陳良基) at a news conference held on Monday (Jan. 20). The output is expected to double to NT$5.2 trillion within a decade and even reach NT$6 trillion by 2030 according to an optimistic forecast, wrote ,.,
            While Samsung is striving to stay ahead of the game through the advancement of chip-making technology with strong backing from the South Korean government, it is unlikely to beat Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the world’s largest semiconductor foundry, Chen believes.,
            Taiwan’s semiconductor businesses thrive on cluster development and an “industry ecology,” as evidenced by the country's many science parks, Chen said. This provides an unrivaled competitive edge for local companies, even faced with competition from Samsung, a conglomerate which receives enormous resources from the government.,
            The island country also boasts top-notch semiconductor packaging, assembly, and testing technology which, along with heterogeneous integration and advanced process control technologies, will receive equal emphasis as Taiwan endeavors to cement its commanding position on the world’s chip manufacturing scene, Chen reckoned.,

							, in Taipei,Sign up to myFT Daily Digest to be the first to know about Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd news.,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, the world’s largest contract chipmaker, said it was ready to deal with potential new US export controls, which it predicted would have only a temporary impact on its business. ,TSMC chairman Mark Liu’s comments on Thursday are the first the company has made on plans by the US government to further , to Chinese telecom gear maker Huawei and thwart China’s rise as a technology power. ,Mr Liu urged the US to remember that TSMC was a “massive” business. “We are everyone’s foundry,” he said. He added that the business would comply with the law in every jurisdiction where it operates. “We will deal with every customer equally and fairly,” he said. ,Since the US , Huawei from buying US supplies last year, TSMC has emerged as the main guarantor for the Chinese company’s continued access to the high-end semiconductors Chinese manufacturers cannot produce themselves. This is possible because US export control rules allow shipments of products that contain less than 25 per cent of US-made content to continue. ,Washington has for several months been leaning on the Taiwanese government to rein in TSMC’s supplies to Huawei, and sales of potentially defence-relevant components to China more generally. Taipei has not complied with the demand. Washington has also demanded TSMC build a fabrication plant in the US and move manufacturing of chips for US military use there. ,Whatever the export controls are, 5G momentum will be just as strong ,The Trump administration is considering tightening the US content threshold from 25 to 10 per cent. Another proposal that could have more wide-ranging fallout would be including US-made semiconductor manufacturing equipment in the calculation of US components. Since such machinery is very expensive, industry experts believe those changes would spell an end to supplies to Huawei altogether. ,Mr Liu’s comments came as the company announced a bullish outlook for this year.,TSMC said it would spend up to $16bn this year on capital investment, up from $14.9bn in 2019. The company expects the ramp-up of 5G telecom services to drive a strong recovery in the semiconductor market. ,TSMC expects the total semiconductor market to grow by 8 per cent and the foundry segment by 17 per cent. “We are confident that we can outgrow foundry by several percentage points,” said chief executive CC Wei. Revenue in the first quarter is forecast to be flat at $10.2bn to $10.3bn.,The company reported a 9.5 per cent increase in revenue and a 16 per cent jump in net income year on year for the fourth quarter of 2019, driven by demand for the semiconductors that power new smartphones. ,TSMC said its outlook had not priced in a shift in US export control rules and that any change would only make a temporary dent. China accounts for 20 per cent of TSMC’s business. “Whatever the export controls are, 5G momentum will be just as strong,” said Wendell Huang, chief financial officer. ,

Malik notes that TSMC said it expects to spend 80% of its 2020 capex budget on advanced process technologies—at 7nm line widths and smaller—and adds that the company’s robust spending plans comes as good news for the semiconductor equipment manufacturing sector.,Malik notes that TSMC expects 5G and high-performance computing applications to drive strong demand over the next several years. The company sees 20% growth this year for smartphones and high-performance computing, with mid-teens growth for automotive applications and wearables.,analyst ,likewise comments in a research note this morning that TSMC’s spending plans are “a modest upside surprise” for semiconductor equipment stocks. , A weekly guide to our best stories on technology, disruption, and the people and stocks in the middle of it all.  ,Some chip investors get nervous when chipmakers are spending on new capacity; the industry tends to overshoot and create price-crushing over-supply. But Ho isn’t worried. “Ultimately, while some may be concerned over this high forecast of capex and equipment spending, we believe that strong demand in these markets and differentiated and leading process technology is driving this capex spend,” he writes. ,“Customers need to pay for this capacity increase if the demand is as healthy and robust as TSMC and other forecasters see,” Ho says. “More importantly, we believe some of these demand trends could be sustainable and could keep capex elevated going into 2021. This upside surprise is part of our overall favorable sentiment entering 2020 and we maintain our positive view on the group and the stocks at this time.”,TSMC shares were recently up slightly to $58.52.
