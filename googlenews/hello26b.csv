Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a think tank funded by the tech industry. “It’s like China woke up and said, ‘We’ve relied too much on the United States.’”</p>,<p class=""css-axufdj evys1bk0"">Semiconductor sales to China, which represent more than half the global chip demand, have fallen, and semiconductor stocks have been <a class=""css-1g7m0tk"" href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/23/business/dealbook/semiconductor-stocks-trade-war.html"" title="""">whipsawed by the trade war</a>.</p>,<p class=""css-axufdj evys1bk0"">Mr. Trump and his supporters say that conflict is no longer avoidable, and that the president’s unconventional approach is necessary to take on a growing threat from China. Officials across the administration look with suspicion on Chinese industrial plans, including Made in China 2025, which <a class=""css-1g7m0tk"" href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/07/business/china-trade-manufacturing-europe.html"" title="""">called for $300 billion in financing and other support</a> for 10 advanced industries, including semiconductors.</p>,<p class=""css-axufdj evys1bk0"">American officials worry that gaining an advantage in semiconductors would give China both a commercial and military edge.</p>,<p class=""css-axufdj evys1bk0"">Then, in April 2018, the administration <a class=""css-1g7m0tk"" href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/03/us/politics/white-house-chinese-imports-tariffs.html"" title="""">announced $50 billion in tariffs</a> that would directly hit semiconductor companies by raising prices for imported equipment and materials. A chip finished in China would be subject to a 25 percent tariff, even if its components had been made in America.</p>,<p class=""css-axufdj evys1bk0"">The tariffs caught the industry by surprise. The Semiconductor Industry Association, a trade group, pushed back, <a class=""css-1g7m0tk"" href=""https://www.semiconductors.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Final-_SIA_Submission_on_301_Tariffs.pdf"" title="""" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">telling the United States trade representative in July 2018</a> that the tariffs would “undermine U.S. technological leadership, cost jobs, and adversely impact U.S. consumers of semiconductor products and the U.S. semiconductor producers.”</p>,<p class=""css-axufdj evys1bk0"">In a statement, Micron said it applauded the deal. “We look forward to additional discussions between the countries on significant issues that are important to Micron and the semiconductor industry, such as intellectual property protection and subsidies,” said Jon Hoganson, Micron’s managing director of global government affairs.</p>,<p class=""css-axufdj evys1bk0"">Its internal semiconductor unit, HiSilicon, has also developed replacements for advanced chips that Huawei once bought from American companies.

semiconductor,china,US tech backlash forces China to be more self-sufficient,"<p>As a result a whole host of Chinese groups are assessing their dependency on US technologies. The largest gap is in hardware, especially the design and manufacture of semiconductors and high-end chips, where China lags far behind the US. They also rely on the US for software, from Google’s mobile apps for Android smartphones — which are now sorely lacking from Huawei’s handsets — to Microsoft’s Windows operating system and its Office suite.</p>,<p>“The Chinese are scouring the world for non-US semiconductor technologies to bridge the gap,” says Bas Fransen, lead analyst at the consultancy TenX2, who has helped introduce Chinese investors to Indian chip designers. “Particularly in Bangalore, you come across many Chinese company reps and also government officials looking for start-ups to acquire or invest in, and to persuade to move to China.”</p>,<p>This push for chip self-sufficiency has boosted smaller private Chinese companies in the industry, according to Charles Liu, a private equity investor formerly on the board of US semiconductor company Applied Materials.</p>",2020-1-14,Financial Times,https://www.ft.com/content/c6993200-1ff3-11ea-b8a1-584213ee7b2b

This is possible because US export control rules allow shipments of products that contain less than 25 per cent of US-made content to continue. </p>,<p>The Trump administration is considering tightening the US content threshold from 25 to 10 per cent. Another proposal that could have more wide-ranging fallout would be including US-made semiconductor manufacturing equipment in the calculation of US components. Since such machinery is very expensive, industry experts believe those changes would spell an end to supplies to Huawei altogether. </p>,<p>TSMC said it would spend up to $16bn this year on capital investment, up from $14.9bn in 2019. The company expects the ramp-up of 5G telecom services to drive a strong recovery in the semiconductor market. </p>,<p>TSMC expects the total semiconductor market to grow by 8 per cent and the foundry segment by 17 per cent. “We are confident that we can outgrow foundry by several percentage points,” said chief executive CC Wei. Revenue in the first quarter is forecast to be flat at $10.2bn to $10.3bn.</p>,<p>The company reported a 9.5 per cent increase in revenue and a 16 per cent jump in net income year on year for the fourth quarter of 2019, driven by demand for the semiconductors that power new smartphones. </p>",2020-1-15,Financial Times,https://www.ft.com/content/0be9ed74-3825-11ea-a6d3-9a26f8c3cba4
semiconductor,china,Wuhan Coronavirus Seriously Affecting Manufacturing ...,"<p>Samsung Electronics’ consumer electronics plant located in Suzhou resumes its operation on Feb. 9. The company is considering producing more products in Southeast Asia and delivering more products from South Korea in view of the possibility that the resumption may be delayed. Although Samsung Electronics’ semiconductor packaging plant and Samsung Display’s LCD manufacturing plant in Suzhou are still in normal operation, the companies are paying close attention to the current situation in that any delay in production will lead to huge losses.</p>,<p>The coronavirus is adversely affecting the global IT industry as a whole and the ongoing recovery of the global semiconductor market is likely to be slowed down. This is because the epidemic is affecting the demand side although it is not directly affecting semiconductor production in China. Foxconn’s manufacturing activities in China are predicted to slow down and the smartphone NAND flash and DRAM demand is likely to fall. In the long term, Chinese IT companies may slide back into a slump after the recent trade agreement between the United States and China, which is the world’s largest semiconductor market and one of the most important markets for South Korean semiconductor companies. Specifically, China, which represents 53 percent of the global semiconductor market, accounted for 24 percent of Samsung Electronics’ sales and 48 percent of SK Hynix’s sales for the first three quarters of 2019.</p>,<p>According to media reports, some Chinese smartphone component manufacturers are predicted to fail to supply their products on time and the failure may lead to a production setback on the part of device manufacturers such as Apple. This will have a negative impact on global semiconductor market conditions in that Apple is a major client for memory chip makers such as Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix. Before the outbreak of the epidemic, the conditions were very favorable. For instance, the spot price of 8Gb DDR4 DRAM rose from US$3.03 to US$3.37 for the first three weeks of this year.</p>,<p>Besides, the demand for semiconductors for servers is currently insufficient to raise semiconductor prices. Although Intel announced on Jan. 23 that it would invest US$17 billion this year, new server and PC CPU manufacturing based on the actual execution of the investment will take time. The date of release of Intel’s server CPU Ice Lake, which is expected to lead to more demand from cloud service providers such as Microsoft, Google and Amazon, is yet to be fixed.</p>,<p>If the semiconductor prices fall again, those service providers will delay their purchase, anticipating an additional decline in price. Although American companies such as Micron Technology and Western Digital are expected to benefit from the production setback in China, it is concerns over an overall decline in demand that are weighing down on the market.</p>",2020-1-30,Business Korea,http://www.businesskorea.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=40661

semiconductor,china,4 Chip Stocks to Gain From China's Reliance on US Tech,"<p>In addition, developments in the semiconductor industry last year brought the significance of U.S. chip-enabled products to the forefront for many crucial Chinese tech products and supply chains.</p>,<p>These developments coupled with an improving U.S.-China trade ties are bound to drive the semiconductor industry.</p>,<p>It is imperative to consider the significance of global semiconductor firms, and more specifically, American chipmakers here. This is because the chip design tools industry is dominated by just four U.S.-based companies, namely, Synopsys, Inc. SNPS, Cadence Design Systems, Inc. CDNS, ANSYS, Inc. ANSS and Mentor Graphics. These four companies control 90% of the world market (as of 2018), according to S2C data.</p>,<p>This dependence on prominent U.S. chipmakers naturally brings semiconductor stocks to investors’ watch list. Since chipmakers comprise the majority of top U.S. companies with revenue exposure to China, these are most sensitive to the upcoming U.S.-China trade agreement.</p>,<p>According to Evercore ISI, China accounted for 35% of global semiconductor sales in 2018. Therefore, with de-escalation in the U.S.-China trade war, one can anticipate a possible rally in semiconductor stocks in the near future as demand for chip-enabled products gain traction in both the countries.</p>,<p>Second, semiconductors form an integral part of almost every crucial, in-demand tech product at present. These chip-enabled products infiltrate everything, including those under the tariff fire right now. The upcoming U.S.-China trade deal is likely to help in that aspect as well.</p>,<p>We have chosen four semiconductor stocks that are well positioned to gain this year from the aforementioned factors.

Intel regained the No. 1 position in the market as the downturn in the memory market negatively impacted many of the top vendors, including Samsung Electronics, the No. 1 vendor by revenue in 2018 and 2017.</p>,<p>“The memory market, which accounted for 26.7 percent of semiconductor sales in 2019, experienced a 31.5 percent decline in revenue in 2019,” said <a href=""https://www.design-reuse.com/exit/?urlid=30762"">Andrew Norwood</a>, research vice president at Gartner. “Within memory, DRAM revenue declined 37.5 percent due to an oversupply that started at the end of 2018 and lasted throughout 2019. The oversupply was caused by a sudden fall in demand from the hyperscale market. This revealed excessive OEM inventory levels that took the first half of the year to correct. Excessive inventory at DRAM vendors in the second half of 2019 pushed pricing lower and resulted in an average selling price (ASP) decline of 47.4 percent in 2019.”</p>,<p>Intel reclaimed its position as the No. 1 global semiconductor vendor by revenue in 2019, recovering the position from Samsung Electronics, which held it for the past two years. Intel’s semiconductor revenue declined 0.7 percent in 2019, driven by a slowdown in the server market, an ongoing constrained CPU supply and the 4Q19 sale of its cellular modem business to Apple. Samsung dropped to the No. 2 position due to the downturn in the memory market (see Table 1). Like all memory vendors, the company struggled with oversupply and falling prices in both the DRAM and NAND flash markets. Samsung’s memory revenue, which accounted for 82 percent of its sales, declined 34 percent in 2019.</p>,<p>“In 2020, we expect to see semiconductor market revenue increase after the high inventory clearance to drive up the chip ASP, especially in the memory sector,” said Mr. Norwood. “The U.S.-China trade war seems to be easing as we move into 2020. However, during 2019 the U.S. added several Chinese companies, including Huawei, to the Entity List restricting the sale of U.S. components. The immediate impact was to push Huawei into looking outside the U.S. for alternative silicon suppliers, with wholly owned HiSilicon at the top of the list as well as alternative suppliers based in Japan, Taiwan, South Korea and China. This will be an area to watch in 2020.”</p>",2020-1-14,EPS News,https://epsnews.com/2020/01/14/semiconductor-market-fell-11-9-in-2019-gartner-reports/

This involves an exceptionally complex set of calculations, because the two superpowers are so intertwined. In technology, most electronic devices in America are assembled in China, and, reciprocally, Chinese tech firms rely on foreign suppliers for over 55% of their high-end inputs into robotics, 65% of those into cloud computing and 90% of those into semiconductors. It would take 10-15 years for China to become self-sufficient in computer chips and for America to shift suppliers (see <a href=""/technology-quarterly/2020/01/02/technological-progress-in-china-could-still-lead-to-fireworks"" data-tegid=""iro044j6i1911jtd4rbf51jl2vj3soch"">Technology Quarterly</a>).

In 2015 its leaders announced a ten-year, $300bn plan, “Made in China 2025”, designed to make its semiconductor, electric-vehicle and artificial-intelligence industries (and many others) as good as any in the world, if not better.

As the plan approaches its halfway point, this conflict seem to be worsening.</p>,<p class=""article__body-text"">Not every peculiarity of the Chinese system is a benefit. State support is frequently doled out to firms or industries based on non-commercial factors. Ignorance and corruption mess things up; so does a thirst for prestige. In the crucial battleground of semiconductors, Beijing’s investment policy is largely based on chasing after the highest-value sections of the supply chain by pumping money into Chinese versions of the foreign companies now commanding those heights. Truly innovative and effective semiconductor businesses sometimes suffer merely because they are less coveted by party officials.</p>,<p class=""article__body-text"">Some trends are subtler. China’s failure to catch up in technologies like internal-combustion engines, civil aviation and, to date, semiconductors shows how hard it is to make humanity’s most complex mechanisms.

semiconductor,china,ASML is too convenient a target for the US – Bits&amp;Chips,"<p>ASML shouldn’t be singled out as the only semiconductor company to be restricted. If the US wants to cut off China, at the very least, ban American technology too.</p>,<p>According to the reports, initially by Nikkei Asian Review and more recently by Reuters, US pressure led the Dutch government to withhold the license required for ASML to ship an EUV scanner to a Chinese customer. This is almost certainly SMIC, China’s most advanced semiconductor company. At this point, the foundry has no need for EUV in manufacturing. But, the same way Intel, TSMC and Samsung had machines to play with years before they even considered moving EUV into production, SMIC obviously will require some time to learn the tricks of the trade.</p>,<p>The document specifically mentions semiconductors and lithography as powering technological revolutions, which China intends to leverage to move up in the world. Shattering the previously widely held assumption that China would never be able to catch up to the West, or if it did, it would be to our advantage too – the government no longer considers China’s ascension on the world stage necessarily a good thing. Just as technology can change our future, so can a more powerful China.</p>,<p>ASML’s technology is of exceptional strategic importance, though. Cutting off the Chinese from EUV will leave them forever stuck at 7-ish nanometer process technology, preserving the country’s dependence on imports for the most advanced semiconductor technology. To cut it off completely, however, one would have to convince TSMC to stop supplying the mainland (the Taiwanese foundry recently shipped the first EUV-made chips to Huawei).</p>,<p class=""excerpt"">After 30 years under the wings of Philips, NXP and finally Nexperia, back-end semiconductor equipment manufacturer ITEC has been detached…</p>,<p>Bits&amp;Chips focuses on news and trends in embedded systems, electronics, mechatronics and semiconductors.

semiconductor,china,What the semiconductor industry tells us about the world ...,"<p class=""article__body-text"">The key to these coded messages is the semiconductor industry. Cars, smartphones, gadgets and cloud-computing servers rely on components, notably memory chips, that are disproportionately made in emerging Asia. The mood-sensitive parts of aggregate demand—capital spending by firms and non-essential purchases by consumers—have microchips in there somewhere. The chip industry itself has savage mini-cycles. When it turns down, it is a sign of trouble ahead in the world economy. When it perks up, as it has done recently, there is reason to be more optimistic.</p>,<p class=""article__body-text"">The cost structure of the chip business is central to this enigma. A semiconductor fabrication plant, or fab, costs billions of dollars to build. A sudden jump in orders, such as occurred in 2017, is met with increased capacity. But when demand falls, the fabs just keep producing. They are highly automated with few staff, so running costs are low. Continuous output makes sense but leads to occasional gluts and sagging prices, as happened through most of last year. Stocks become bloated. When demand picks up again, as it did late last year, stocks are drawn down and prices begin to stabilise.</p>,<p class=""article__body-text"">What signals should market cryptologists be looking at? One measure is exports of semiconductors from South Korea, says Alicia Garcia-Herrero, chief economist for Asia at Natixis, an investment bank, who is based in Hong Kong. South Korea is pivotal to Asia’s supply chain, she says, and its shipments of semiconductors help predict exports in the region more generally. After a brutal 2019 the trend has bottomed out and is turning (see chart). Another signal is the financial health of big Asian chip companies, such as Samsung and <small>SK</small> Hynix. Those averse to digging deep into financial statements could simply monitor industry share prices. Or they could look for inflection points in the price of <small>DRAM</small>, a type of memory chip used to store data on servers and computers.</p>",2020-1-16,The Economist,https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2020/01/16/what-the-semiconductor-industry-tells-us-about-the-world-economy

The oversupply was caused by a sudden fall in demand from the hyperscale market. This revealed excessive OEM inventory levels that took the first half of the year to correct. Excessive inventory at DRAM vendors in the second half of 2019 pushed pricing lower and resulted in an average selling price (ASP) decline of 47.4% in 2019,"" he added. <br>   <br>  Though Intel did reclaim the top spot, it also saw revenue decline of around 1% in 2019 compared to the year prior. Constrained CPU supply and the <a href=""https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-acquires-intels-modem-business-in-1-billion-deal/"" target=""_blank"">sale of its modem business to Apple</a> were also reasons for the slight revenue decline, Gartner noted. <br>   <br>  Meanwhile, other semiconductor companies focused on memory saw drastic declines in their revenue: Samsung fell 29% from 2018, SK Hynix dropped 38%, and Micron 33%. <br>   <br>  ""In 2020, we expect to see semiconductor market revenue increase after the high inventory clearance to drive up the chip ASP, especially in the memory sector,"" said Norwood.  <br>   <br>  ""The US-China trade war seems to be easing as we move into 2020. However, during 2019, the US added several Chinese companies, including Huawei, to the Entity List restricting the sale of US components. The immediate impact was to push Huawei into looking outside the US for alternative silicon suppliers, with wholly-owned HiSilicon at the top of the list as well as alternative suppliers based in Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, and China.

semiconductor,china,South Korea no rival to Taiwan in semiconductor industry ...,"<p>
            TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — South Korea can hardly compete with Taiwan in semiconductor manufacturing despite the ambitious move by Samsung Electronics to put a 3-nanometer semiconductor node into commercial production, said Taiwan’s top tech official.</p>,<p>
            Taiwan’s semiconductor industry had an annual output valued at NT$2.6 trillion (US$867 billion) in 2019, said Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) Minister Chen Liang-gee (陳良基) at a news conference held on Monday (Jan. 20). The output is expected to double to NT$5.2 trillion within a decade and even reach NT$6 trillion by 2030 according to an optimistic forecast, wrote <a href=""https://money.udn.com/money/story/5612/4299487"" target=""_blank"">UDN</a>.</p>,<p>
            While Samsung is striving to stay ahead of the game through the advancement of chip-making technology with strong backing from the South Korean government, it is unlikely to beat Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the world’s largest semiconductor foundry, Chen believes.</p>,<p>
            Taiwan’s semiconductor businesses thrive on cluster development and an “industry ecology,” as evidenced by the country's many science parks, Chen said. This provides an unrivaled competitive edge for local companies, even faced with competition from Samsung, a conglomerate which receives enormous resources from the government.</p>,<p>
            The island country also boasts top-notch semiconductor packaging, assembly, and testing technology which, along with heterogeneous integration and advanced process control technologies, will receive equal emphasis as Taiwan endeavors to cement its commanding position on the world’s chip manufacturing scene, Chen reckoned.</p>,<p>

Zhaoxin (meaning “million-core,” according to Wikipedia) launched a series of chips based on the old VIA Isaiah core. Over the years, the company has evolved the original Isaiah architecture into a higher-performing CPU core, with more cores, higher clocks, and a lower process node. The current CPU family’s code name is Lujiazui and it’s used in the KX-6000 series of products.</p>,<p>Anyone looking for a reason to dismiss the KX-U6780A will find reason to do so. Best-case, you’d be buying performance similar to what you could get from Intel or AMD 6-8 years ago. Focusing on that issue, however, misses the rapid rise of China’s manufacturing and <a href=""https://www.extremetech.com/tag/semiconductors"">semiconductor</a> industry. Zhaoxin has evolved its product line rapidly, moving from Isaiah-derived parts directly based on the old VIA architecture to newer chips that have significantly improved the performance of the underlying CPU. While the new chip may not pack much performance compared with a top-end part from AMD or Intel, the KX-U6780A is still much faster <em>relative</em> to AMD or Intel than previous CPUs the company or country has fielded.</p>,<p>China has set aggressive targets for itself in terms of semiconductor self-sufficiency, and ramping up the performance and production of its home-grown products is part of that.

semiconductor,china,Opinion | Technology is set to be the main front in the US-China trade war,"<p>

	The US has already imposed severe constraints on technology supply chains that involve sales of semiconductors and components to China. Over 200 Chinese entities have been placed on a blacklist, including telecom equipment manufacturers like Huawei and ZTE, artificial intelligence companies like SenseTime, Megvii, Yitu and iFlytek, and surveillance system makers like HikVision and Dahua Technology. While the ostensible reasons for their blacklisting is national security and human rights, isolating some of China’s most competitive technology firms from the global supply chain will set them back, at least in the short-term.</p>,<p>

	In response, China plans to increase domestic production of key components, especially semiconductors, from around 30% now to 75% by 2025. That is an impressive target, but the economics are such that even China will find it extremely difficult to break into the leading edge semiconductor manufacturing business. Last month, the Central Office of the Chinese Communist Party ordered all government offices and public institutions to replace their computer equipment with those produced by domestic manufacturers. The transition is to be completed by 2020. The hardware itself is easy to replace, but changing operating systems and application software will not be easy. Think of it as a Y2K-kind of project that has to be executed without the benefit of an army of Indian software engineers.</p>",2020-1-19,Mint,https://www.livemint.com/opinion/columns/technology-is-set-to-be-the-main-front-in-the-us-china-trade-war-11579444057975.html

semiconductor,china,Assuring Taiwan's Innovation Future,"<p>Taiwan’s innovation ecosystem has faced particular pressures on its ability to reorient from semiconductor and chipset design and fabrication toward new, future-facing industries. Many of the new systems in these industries do require advanced hardware. But they also require parallel adaptations in software, and the firms and national innovation systems that lead these industries tend to derive their competitive advantages from hardware-software integration.</p>,<p>In the 1980s and 1990s, mutually beneficial collaborations between Silicon Valley and the broader Hsinchu-Taipei region supported entrepreneurial dynamics and the growth of the indigenous semiconductor and PC industries in Taiwan. In the 2000s, however, Taiwan’s technology ecosystem hollowed out as PC, component systems, and mobile device manufacturing moved across the Taiwan Strait to mainland China. Today, the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) annual survey has shown that over 80 percent of Taiwan’s information and communication technology (ICT)–related products are manufactured in China.<sup>1</sup></p>,<p>For another, the bleeding of talent across the Taiwan Strait has been a persistent challenge to Taiwan-based industry. Since 2017, Beijing has sought to ramp up its own domestic semiconductor industry, in part by poaching Taiwan-based talent.<sup>4</sup> One recent report suggests that as many as 3,000 semiconductor engineers have departed Taiwan for positions at Chinese companies, a figure that would amount to nearly one-tenth of Taiwan's roughly 40,000 engineers involved in semiconductor R&amp;D.<sup>5</sup></p>,<p>Not surprisingly, a single industry—semiconductors—dominates this picture, just as it has for nearly four decades. MOEA figures show that semiconductors accounted for 29.1 percent of Taiwan’s total exports in 2017 and, according to MOF data, a whopping 62.6 percent of its exports of technology devices.<sup>13</sup> Three other hardware-related sectors—flat panels, wireless transmission devices, and mobile phones—comprised another 10.5 percent of the 2017 technology product export mix.</p>,<p>The dominance of hardware, especially of semiconductors, reflects the core features of the three-legged model that made Taiwan so successful in the formative developmental period of the 1980s and 1990s.</p>,<p>Taiwan, in effect, discovered Silicon Valley decades before the rest of the world. That discovery—and the process of “brain circulation” of Taiwan-born but U.S.-educated and -trained engineers and entrepreneurs—in turn drove a wave of entrepreneurial growth in semiconductors, PCs, and other hardware-related industries.<sup>16</sup></p>,<p>Taiwanese from the United States advised policymakers in Taipei during the 1960s and 1970s on economic development strategies, successfully advocating a focus on developing capabilities in leading edge technologies, such as semiconductors, rather than following the Korean model of moving into automobile manufacturing. They also worked with their peers at home. Some ultimately returned to Taiwan to take up leadership positions that helped expand the island’s system of higher education; its research capabilities, including the formation of the Electronics Research Service Organization (ERSO) and ITRI; and the development of a domestic venture capital industry.<sup>17</sup></p>,<p>Starting in the 1980s, this generation of returnees to Taiwan began to set up their own firms. Many of these became the backbone of Taiwan’s early wave of semiconductor, PC, and electronic systems producers. The new Taiwan-based firms subsequently forged additional and follow-on connections to Silicon Valley firms, who then set up their own manufacturing bases in Taiwan.</p>,<p>Taiwan’s cheap labor advantage allowed it to quickly enter the global semiconductor market, which had been established in the United States in the 1950s by firms such as Fairchild (founded in 1957), National Semiconductor (founded in 1959), and Intel (founded in 1968). But Taiwan-based firms then quickly upgraded their quality, specialization, and production capabilities.</p>,<p>TSMC and other Taiwan-based market leaders in semiconductors and chipsets—such as United Microelectronics (UMC), founded in 1980 as another spinoff from ITRI—pioneered the dedicated semiconductor foundry business model, providing advanced chip production capabilities as a service.</p>,<p>All semiconductor firms at the time were vertically integrated, with both chip design and manufacturing conducted in-house. The foundry model proved to be a significant innovation because it allowed for the flourishing of new generations of firms that focused only on chip design and avoided the huge costs and complexities of production facilities.</p>,<p>Taiwan soon became a center of chip design expertise, with fabless chip design firm Mediatek (founded in 1997) as an early success story. Today, TSMC remains the world’s leading semiconductor fab, with cutting-edge production technologies and close to half of the global foundry market.</p>,<p>This three-legged model—smart government competition policy, aggressive internationalization, and the incubation of an independent innovation capability—yielded a highly decentralized and competitive manufacturing ecosystem. This promoted Taiwan’s leadership in semiconductor design and production, contributing to a flourishing period for its ICT manufacturing during the 1980s and 1990s. From the earliest days, the focus within this emerging ecosystem was on production for export, particularly of intermediate goods. The keys to the success of these globally competitive, Taiwan-based hardware firms became offshoring and comprehensive integration into global value chains.</p>,<p>But Taiwan’s sheer dependence on the IT sector in the overall export picture has been a critical and persistent theme in its economic development. Because that dependence has continued to this day, it has created vulnerabilities, even though champion companies like TSMC have capitalized on sales and supply chain opportunities to become globally dominant industry players in such areas as semiconductors and chips.</p>,<p>With China, while much R&amp;D remained in Taiwan, particularly critical semiconductor-related design knowledge, many hardware manufacturing supply chains shifted across the Taiwan Strait, especially to the Pearl River delta in Guangdong Province and the greater Shanghai region, because of cost advantages. By the middle of this decade, especially with the transition of mobile phones from a premium product to a globally popular one, the hardware ecosystem around the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, in particular, had developed distinctive and dynamic characteristics.<sup>18</sup> Above all, Shenzhen boasts rapid and efficient logistics to enable hardware innovators to design, prototype, and then repeatedly tweak and retweak a hardware product on very short production cycles. Today, that unique Shenzhen ecosystem mixes manufacturing prowess—much of it acquired from U.S., European, Taiwanese, and other Asian firms that set up fabrication shops there—with a deep stock of engineers.</p>,<p>Above all, the Taiwan ecosystem has faced special pressures on its ability to reorient from semiconductor and chipset design and fabrication toward new, future-facing industries. Many of the new systems in these industries do require advanced hardware. But they also require parallel adaptations in software, and the firms and national innovation systems that lead these industries tend to derive their competitive advantages from hardware-software integration.</p>,<p>This means that Taiwan’s education system is producing insufficient technical talent while concentrating the talent pool that it does produce into legacy fields connected to semiconductor design, such as electrical engineering. Taiwan has underinvested in emerging areas, such as computer and data sciences.</p>,<p>First, where the transpacific ecosystem that defined semiconductors and hardware innovation in the 1980s and 1990s linked Taiwan to Silicon Valley, the one that has now come to define AI links China to Silicon Valley. In effect, it is mainland China-based, not Taiwan-based, engineers and entrepreneurs who have forged the links to the United States that will define many aspects of the future of AI. Ironically enough, such a highly internationalized transpacific ecosystem between Beijing and California mirrors the internationalization and brain circulation that defined Taiwan’s past success.</p>,<p>Moving more of Taiwan’s economy into those segments will be a challenge because, for the last twenty years, Taiwan’s efforts to move beyond low-value-added manufacturing through upgraded R&amp;D have yielded mixed results. Manufacturing today accounts for just under 30 percent of Taiwan’s GDP and job creation. Yet Taiwan ranks five to six points below leading countries in value added—with the exception of the ICT and semiconductor sectors.</p>,<p>This will compensate for the smaller scale of its domestic market wh­en compared to, say, China or India. For example, new semiconductor and AI investments could aim to complement the U.S. buildout of cloud and quantum computing.</p>,<p>What is more, Taiwan could make itself into a regional hub for high-tech education by offering engineering programs in English, in particular for the electrical and mechanical engineering requisites of semiconductors and chipsets. Students from Southeast Asia, South Asia, and other parts of the world may find the cost of engineering programs in the United States, Europe, or Australia to be prohibitive. So, Taiwan should aim to make itself into the next alternative for international students in these specialized areas of engineering.</p>,<p>Yet the central question for Taiwan is whether it can cultivate a STEM talent pool not for right now but for ten to twenty years down the road—a pool that combines technical with operational and business skills, focuses not just on hardware but software and integration, and moves beyond traditional strengths in semiconductors and chips into fields like AI, quantum, and cybersecurity.</p>,<p>A model of sorts already exists in Taiwan’s semiconductor industry. As public funding declines, industry players have agreed to furnish matching funds for university professors and laboratories. This government-industry match funding model could be extended to next-generation fields.</p>,<p>The role of government in any national innovation system is often described as that of a facilitator, enabling the private sector to exploit the economy’s current comparative advantage while strategically guiding a shift toward new areas.<sup>48</sup> That well describes Taiwan’s legacy of success. As noted in a recent IMF report, after all, nothing about Taiwan’s factor endowments predisposed it to a comparative advantage in semiconductors in the first place.<sup>49</sup></p>,<p>Yet one important lesson of Taiwan’s experience with semiconductors is that, much as was the case with hardware, Taiwan’s next advantage will likely emerge only through targeted and sustained investment. Boosting research spending should be a particular priority: for long-term investment in emerging technologies, Taiwan’s government will need to administer a steady supply of “patient capital” to enable new industrial clusters and advantages to emerge.</p>,<p>For instance, due to the lack of a pipeline, Taiwan’s leading semiconductor firms have proposed more spending in at least three key areas: advanced manufacturing cycles, radio frequency, and quantum. Such increased research spending is particularly urgent in the context of the global productivity slowdown. A recent Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) report estimates that between 2001 and 2013, frontier firms experienced productivity growth of 2.8 percent per year compared to just 0.6 percent for others.<sup>50</sup> Declining productivity means, in turn, that a proportionate increase of effort will be required just to maintain the status quo level of growth.</p>",2020-1-29,Carnegie Endowment for International Peace,https://carnegieendowment.org/2020/01/29/assuring-taiwan-s-innovation-future-pub-80920

semiconductor,china,Semiconductor Stocks Lead The Charge As Industry Cycle ...,"<p>Investors in semiconductor stocks could hardly be blamed if they headed into January feeling a fear of heights. The industry benchmark Philadelphia chip index surged 60% in 2019, its biggest gain in a decade. That led analysts to question valuations, with some predicting a slower-than-usual first quarter.</p>,<p>All agreed that more gains were in the offing — the question was when. Then, on Thursday, the semiconductor industry received a bolt of good news. <strong>Taiwan Semiconductor</strong> (<a class=""ticker"" href=""https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM"" target=""_blank"">TSM</a>) — a leading provider of chip manufacturing services to <strong>Apple</strong> (<a class=""ticker"" href=""https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL"" target=""_blank"">AAPL</a>), <strong>Advanced Micro Devices</strong> (<a class=""ticker"" href=""https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD"" target=""_blank"">AMD</a>) and <strong>Nvidia</strong> (<a class=""ticker"" href=""https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA"" target=""_blank"">NVDA</a>) — reported its first earnings beat in three quarters and guided higher for the coming quarter. The bellwether company forecast higher investments in semiconductor capital equipment for the year, on the back of strengthening 5G wireless and high-performance computing.</p>,<p>That outlook fits the view of a number of analysts who contend that semiconductor stocks have room to run higher this year, even after their big run-up in 2019. One optimist is analyst C.J. Muse of Evercore ISI. Muse forecast in a Jan. 13 report that semiconductor industry revenue will rise 11% in 2020.</p>,<p>""Semiconductors are a secular growth story, on the cusp of true rising silicon intensity led by AI and Big Data (creation, transmission, analytics, storage) that will continue to drive the third meaningful upcycle for semiconductors,"" Muse said.</p>,<p>In 2019, the Philadelphia semiconductor index, known as SOX, surged 60.1%, rebounding from a decline of 7.8% in 2018. It was the Philly chip index's best year since 2009, and well above the Nasdaq's 2019 gain of 35.2%.

He is forecasting a ""muted"" recovery.</p>,<p>""With estimates falling throughout 2019 yet stocks rising to near all-time highs, we find the stock setup relatively challenging heading into 2020, as a solid, and potentially optimistic, fundamental recovery already seems to be priced into stocks,"" Seymore said.

Tariffs still impact more than $350 billion worth of imported Chinese goods -- including the chips and passives that are staples of electronic systems -- and economic indicators are suppressing spending.</p>,<p>“Products are growing something like 1 percent, so that’s impacting the semiconductor market,” said McClean.  “Consumers need to feel good about the economy to feel good about upgrading their cars, PCs or smart phones.” Global economic forecasts for 2020 are not inspiring confidence.</p>,<p>The fortunes of the semiconductor market are now tied to gross domestic product (GDP) growth rather than historic boom-bust cycles, according to McClean. Twenty years ago, 60 percent of semiconductors were shipped to businesses that are famously unable to forecast; now, 60 percent of chips go into consumer devices.

semiconductor,china,"Moore's Law, Supply Chains And Security","<p>All across the semiconductor industry, significant changes are underway. Some of these have been in the works for some time. Others are new or accelerating faster than anyone would have predicted a year ago.</p>,<p>The companies going in this direction are not necessarily the same ones pushing it in the past. “Chasing Moore’s Law with decreasing feature-size, especially below 7nm, becomes an expensive value proposition,” says Vic Kulkarni, vice president and chief strategist for <a href=""https://semiengineering.com/entities/ansys/"">ANSYS</a>. “This is an answer for the privileged few large, rich Tier 1 semiconductor and bespoke silicon system companies like Tesla, Microsoft, Google, Facebook, and so on.”</p>,<p>Many designs require both <a href=""https://semiengineering.com/knowledge_centers/packaging/advanced-packaging/"">advanced packaging</a> and advanced node technology. “As more semiconductor companies look for alternatives to Moore’s Law scaling and begin to fully realize the benefits of modern-day multi-chip/<a href=""https://semiengineering.com/knowledge_centers/packaging/advanced-packaging/chiplets/"">chiplet</a> packaging including stacking, expect to see a dramatic reduction in single monolithic SoC design starts,” says John Park, product management group director for IC packaging and cross-platform solutions at <a href=""https://semiengineering.com/entities/cadence-design-systems/"">Cadence</a>. “Instead, expect 2020 to launch the age of ‘More Than Moore’, namely multi-chip/chiplet packaging. Foundries and <a href=""https://semiengineering.com/knowledge_centers/packaging/outsourced-semiconductor-assembly-and-test/"">OSATs</a> will continue to battle for market share, driving cost — the key metric — lower for state-of-the-art multi-chip/chiplet packaging. This will greatly accelerate the transition to multi-chip/chiplet packaging and heterogeneous systems as an alternative to CMOS scaling. The evolution of Moore’s Law is about more than just the limitations of physics. Chasing the latest design node is expensive, hard, and requires large design teams. Big chips typically don’t yield very well, either. Fewer and fewer companies want to take on these challenges when a viable alternative in packaging is so readily available.”</p>,<p><strong>Supply chain</strong><br>
Chiplets and 3D integration require some changes in the supply chain. “Continued consolidation and collaboration across the semiconductor industry, along with derivative designs and systems that incorporate multiple vendors’ IP, will result in increased IP reuse,” says Simon Rance, head of marketing at <a href=""https://semiengineering.com/entities/cliosoft-inc/"">ClioSoft</a>. “Finding and keeping track of reusable IP will increasingly become more difficult due to its multi-faceted nature, i.e. revisions, configurations, legal terms and conditions, etc. Growth around IP reuse will compound the problems already facing IP vendors, such as IP theft and data leakage. We will see significant changes in the IP world, both from the user and the vendor side as IP reuse continues to grow in 2020 and beyond.”</p>,<p><strong>Politics</strong><br>
The tensions between the United States and China are having significant impact on multiple levels. “The tariff wars with China and targeting of specific companies, such as Huawei/HiSilicon, may have poked a sleeping giant,” says ClioSoft’s Rance. “China will not be held hostage to the U.S. and its politics. They will redouble their efforts to become self-reliant in crucial technology, not only in semiconductors, but also in EDA software. While Chinese EDA software companies, such as Huada Empyrean, may not be globally competitive, the Chinese government will provide incentives to help improve their market share in China. U.S. EDA companies are likely to lose market share in China, at least in the lower end of the market.”</p>,<p>There also may be unintended winners. “China spends more on importing semiconductor chips than it does oil, illustrating its deep dependency on foreign chips,” says Jones. “The 16-month U.S.-China trade war hit chip companies directly. European suppliers have been put in a strong position to support both China and the USA in their technology advancements, creating some interesting opportunities in the market while also causing an acceleration of China home-grown solutions. In 2020, the importance of China as a customer base will continue to grow. The ready availability of funding in that region will also help this acceleration.”</p>,<p>Rethinking how to improve performance and lower power in semiconductors.</p>",2020-1-16,Semiconductor Engineering,https://semiengineering.com/moores-law-supply-chains-and-security/
semiconductor,china,5G and the chip battle EJINSIGHT,"<p>Let’s look at the data. The accompanying chart shows the historical monthly series of US semiconductors shipment value by destination, compiled by the US Semiconductor Industry Association. One can see the imports from Japan and Europe have both been stable over time. Import from Asia Pacific has been surging since 2002 and that from Americas (ex-US) has been up slightly in recent years. Note since 2015 China is reported separately from Asia.</p>,<p>US President Donald Trump has been famous for his tariff weapon. We might wonder what if a tariff is levied not on US imports but the semiconductor exports to China? Taking an “entry rate” 10 percent of that inevitable amount this would generate a monthly tariff of US$1.07 billion or an annual amount of US$12.8 billion, which is about the additional value of agricultural products to be purchased from US by China within this year under the first phase of trade agreement.</p>",2020-1-22,ejinsight.com,http://www.ejinsight.com/20200122-5g-and-the-chip-battle/

semiconductor,china,Technological progress in China could still lead to fireworks,"<p class=""article__body-text"">One reason not to fear imminent decoupling is that, even at its most successful, China’s model of technological development can proceed only so fast. When a technology is complex and expensive, progress is slow, as is shown in the manufacture of semiconductors. Even assuming you know how to build and run a cutting-edge chip factory, it takes tens of billions of dollars to do so. It also requires close co-operation with an array of high-tech suppliers who are already tightly bound to the existing market leaders.</p>,<p class=""article__body-text"">Since China will not be capturing a large slice of the semiconductor manufacturing pie any time soon, and because semiconductors are vital to future economic growth, the world’s existing locus of chip production gains heightened strategic importance. That the locus is Taiwan—over which China claims sovereignty, and where America has enough influence to urge restrictions on exports—further complicates the situation. Both American and Chinese firms rely on Taiwan for chip supplies, adding to its potential as a cause of conflict. If the tension between America and China keeps ratcheting up, the island nation could well come under pressure from both sides to curtail its supplies to the other.

These decisions introduced a degree of uncertainty into South Korea’s economic relationship with Japan that had not existed since the normalization of relations in 1965.</p>,<p>The restrictions sparked concerns because hydrogen fluoride, fluorinated polyimide, and photoresists are all critical to the production of semiconductors, South Korea’s <a href=""https://thediplomat.com/2019/01/is-this-the-end-of-south-koreas-semi-charmed-export-life/"">top export industry</a>, and largely only produced by Japanese companies.

semiconductor,china,Epitaxy equipment market to grow from $940m to over $6bn ...,"<p>From a technical point of view, metal-organic  chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) serves most of the III-V compound  semiconductor epitaxy industry, such as gallium arsenide (GaAs)- and gallium nitride (GaN)-based  devices. High-temperature (HT) chemical vapor deposition  (CVD) serves the majority of mainstream  silicon-based components and silicon carbide (SiC) devices. </p>,<p>The semiconductor industry has been  traditionally dominated by silicon substrates. Although silicon is still by far  the most dominant material (with more than 80% market share), alternative  non-silicon-based substrates like GaAs, GaN, SiC and InP (indium phosphide) are gaining  momentum within the ‘More than Moore’ industry. Indeed, new applications are  emerging along with stringent requirements where silicon solutions are not able  to provide the performance expected. Innovative substrate materials are hence  being considered by semiconductor manufacturers. </p>,<p>On the other hand, wide-bandgap (WBG) materials like  SiC substrates have found opportunities in the power electronics market. Here,  power consumption reduction is required for electrification of transportation,  renewable energy, motor drives and some power supply applications. Despite the  high price of SiC, such substrates represent a strong asset for high-voltage  applications, and are thus considered to be a technology choice for some metal-oxide-semiconductor  field-effect transistor  (MOSFET) and diode products. </p>,<p>Looking ahead, photonics products like vertical-cavity  surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) operating in the IR spectrum  (typically processed on GaAs) are making serious inroads into the epitaxy  market. In addition, GaAs is especially advantageous for radio-frequency (RF) products such  as small-cell implementation, for both sub-6GHz frequencies and the first  millimetre-wave (mmWave) small cells in the 28-39GHz range. With the cellphone  transition from 4G to 5G, Yole hence expects GaAs to remain the mainstream  technology for sub-6GHz frequencies instead of complementary  metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) silicon, since it is the only  technology able to meet increasing power level and linearity requirements  imposed by antenna board-space reductions as well as carrier aggregation and multiple-input  multiple-output (MIMO) technology. </p>,<p>Yole notes that, for compound  semiconductor-based devices such as laser diodes, micro-LEDs and VCSELs, the  MOCVD reactor market could be affected by possible technology transitions to  molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). In fact, MBE could bring greater  advantages in terms of yield and uniformity for VCSELs as well as for  high-frequency 5G RF applications. In the case of SiC power devices, MOCVD  manufacturers are trying to identify and develop new MOCVD technologies to  address the SiC market, where HT CVD is currently predominant. </p>",2020-1-24,Semiconductor Today,http://www.semiconductor-today.com/news_items/2020/jan/yole-240120.shtml

semiconductor,china,Chinese inventiveness shows the weakness of the law,"<p class=""article__body-text"">Mr Li started thinking about how to make a laser projector using just blue light. Most cheap <small>LED</small> bulbs work by shining blue light generated by a semiconductor through a phosphorescent filter that absorbs it and re-emits red and green light in its place, thereby producing white light from the mixture. The same works with a laser but, because its light is so intense—1,000 times brighter than an <small>LED</small>—the phosphor filter burns out immediately. Mr Li came up with a ridiculously simple solution. Instead of keeping the filter static in front of the blue laser light, he set it spinning, a disc of phosphor which, if kept moving, could pump out red and green light, as well as blue, while relying on just a blue laser source. The spinning filter did not burn out, because no single spot was ever subjected to enough light intensity for long enough. Mr Li had found a way to tap the cheap blue-<small>LED</small> supply chain and build a laser projector that was ten times cheaper than the competition.</p>,<p class=""article__body-text"">In the case of more complex technologies like vehicles, nuclear plants or semiconductors, other factors matter more—relationships with suppliers, access to affordable labour, the know-how to use the <small>IP</small> at all.

SiC stands out because it’s more efficient with higher breakdown voltages than traditional power semis.</p>,<p>“When you’re talking about the silicon foundry model, it is very successful,” said Hong Lin, an analyst at Yole Développement. “I am not here to say there is no chance for the foundry model in silicon carbide. In the power semiconductor business, if we’re looking at today’s IGBTs designs, there are foundries here. But it’s more of an IDM business.”</p>,<p>“SiC and GaN are promising components for the power semiconductor market due to the higher efficiency and smaller form factor characteristics compared to their silicon-based peers like power MOSFETs and IGBTs” said Steven Liu, vice president of corporate marketing at <a href=""https://semiengineering.com/entities/umc/"">UMC</a>. “The devices can be made much smaller in size for the same relative voltage and current handling capability. GaN has made inroads in applications requiring 600 volts and below, while SiC has made inroads in applications requiring 1,200 volts and above.”</p>,<p>Only a few vendors are producing devices at those volumes. If not, it makes sense to use foundries. “The reason for going down this path is that it’s really the most capital efficient way to build a semiconductor business,” said Chris Dries, president and CEO at UnitedSiC, a fabless SiC device supplier. UnitedSiC has its 150mm products made by X-Fab.

semiconductor,china,'5G adoption to catalyse semiconductor sector amid trade war ...,"<p>KUALA LUMPUR: Barring any further escalation of trade or geopolitical tensions which could disrupt the already tepid growth environment, prospects for the semiconductor sector are looking positive due to the anticipated adoption of 5G, analysts said.</p>,<p>“We foresee OSAT (outsourced semiconductor assembly and test) players like Globetronics Technology Bhd missing out on the growth momentum even though its end customer is in the smartphone business. This is due to the fact that its main focus is on smartphone light sensors and TWS (True Wireless Stereo) gesture sensors, which do not correlate with the growth of 5G,” he observed.</p>,<p>It is worth noting that the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics recently projected that annual global sales of semiconductors were expected to fall 12.8% in 2019 to US$409 billion (RM1.66 trillion) from US$468.8 billion in 2018.</p>,<p>While the global semiconductor market slumped somewhat in 2019 compared to the record sales posted in 2018, it has been reported that the recent trend is more positive, with month-on-month sales increasing in October 2019 for the fourth consecutive month.</p>,<p>AmInvestment Bank has maintained its neutral outlook on the sector, considering the near-term uncertainty in orders clouding the outlook of some semiconductor companies, arising from the long-standing technology and trade spat between the US and China.</p>,<p>“Note that semiconductor is a global industry. Thus, cooperation between countries would be instrumental in driving the industry.</p>,<p>“To maintain earnings the growth trajectory, semiconductor companies are aggressive diversifying their product and service portfolio, and expanding the customer base in the process.”</p>",2020-1-15,The Edge Markets,https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/5g-adoption-catalyse-semiconductor-sector-amid-trade-war-uncertainties
