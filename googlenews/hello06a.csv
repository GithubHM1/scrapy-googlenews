semiconductor,china,Trump’s China Deal Creates Collateral Damage for Tech Firms,"WASHINGTON — Among the corporate titans recognized last week by President Trump during a White House signing ceremony for his China trade deal was Sanjay Mehrotra, the chief executive of Micron Technology, whose Idaho semiconductor company is at the heart of Mr. Trump’s trade war,But Mr. Trump’s aggressive trade approach has also accelerated a technology arms race between the two countries, putting American companies like Micron at risk as the two nations try to decouple their economies. In an effort to reduce its reliance on American components, China has expedited efforts to produce its own semiconductors, driverless cars, artificial intelligence and other technologies. Those efforts, along with the Trump administration’s desire to restrict the sales of American tech products to China, could hurt the very companies Mr. Trump set out to protect,“Let’s be clear, the trade war has been very bad for the semiconductor industry in several ways,” said Robert D. Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a think tank funded by the tech industry. “It’s like China woke up and said, ‘We’ve relied too much on the United States.’”,Semiconductor sales to China, which represent more than half the global chip demand, have fallen, and semiconductor stocks have been whipsawed by the trade war,Mr. Trump and his supporters say that conflict is no longer avoidable, and that the president’s unconventional approach is necessary to take on a growing threat from China. Officials across the administration look with suspicion on Chinese industrial plans, including Made in China 2025, which called for $300 billion in financing and other support for 10 advanced industries, including semiconductors,American officials worry that gaining an advantage in semiconductors would give China both a commercial and military edge,Then, in April 2018, the administration announced $50 billion in tariffs that would directly hit semiconductor companies by raising prices for imported equipment and materials. A chip finished in China would be subject to a 25 percent tariff, even if its components had been made in America,The tariffs caught the industry by surprise. The Semiconductor Industry Association, a trade group, pushed back, telling the United States trade representative in July 2018 that the tariffs would “undermine U.S. technological leadership, cost jobs, and adversely impact U.S. consumers of semiconductor products and the U.S. semiconductor producers.”,In a statement, Micron said it applauded the deal. “We look forward to additional discussions between the countries on significant issues that are important to Micron and the semiconductor industry, such as intellectual property protection and subsidies,” said Jon Hoganson, Micron’s managing director of global government affairs,Its internal semiconductor unit, HiSilicon, has also developed replacements for advanced chips that Huawei once bought from American companies. Huawei said its 2019 sales topped $120 billion, representing 18 percent growth over the year before — less than its initial target, but not by much",2020-1-20,The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/20/business/economy/trump-us-china-deal-micron-trade-war.html
semiconductor,china,Chipmaker TSMC says ready for potential new US export controls,"Since the US barred Huawei from buying US supplies last year, TSMC has emerged as the main guarantor for the Chinese company’s continued access to the high-end semiconductors Chinese manufacturers cannot produce themselves. This is possible because US export control rules allow shipments of products that contain less than 25 per cent of US-made content to continue. ,The Trump administration is considering tightening the US content threshold from 25 to 10 per cent. Another proposal that could have more wide-ranging fallout would be including US-made semiconductor manufacturing equipment in the calculation of US components. Since such machinery is very expensive, industry experts believe those changes would spell an end to supplies to Huawei altogether. ,TSMC said it would spend up to $16bn this year on capital investment, up from $14.9bn in 2019. The company expects the ramp-up of 5G telecom services to drive a strong recovery in the semiconductor market. ,TSMC expects the total semiconductor market to grow by 8 per cent and the foundry segment by 17 per cent. “We are confident that we can outgrow foundry by several percentage points,” said chief executive CC Wei. Revenue in the first quarter is forecast to be flat at $10.2bn to $10.3bn,The company reported a 9.5 per cent increase in revenue and a 16 per cent jump in net income year on year for the fourth quarter of 2019, driven by demand for the semiconductors that power new smartphones. ",2020-1-15,Financial Times,https://www.ft.com/content/0be9ed74-3825-11ea-a6d3-9a26f8c3cba4
semiconductor,china,US tech backlash forces China to be more self-sufficient,"As a result a whole host of Chinese groups are assessing their dependency on US technologies. The largest gap is in hardware, especially the design and manufacture of semiconductors and high-end chips, where China lags far behind the US. They also rely on the US for software, from Google’s mobile apps for Android smartphones — which are now sorely lacking from Huawei’s handsets — to Microsoft’s Windows operating system and its Office suite,“The Chinese are scouring the world for non-US semiconductor technologies to bridge the gap,” says Bas Fransen, lead analyst at the consultancy TenX2, who has helped introduce Chinese investors to Indian chip designers. “Particularly in Bangalore, you come across many Chinese company reps and also government officials looking for start-ups to acquire or invest in, and to persuade to move to China.”,This push for chip self-sufficiency has boosted smaller private Chinese companies in the industry, according to Charles Liu, a private equity investor formerly on the board of US semiconductor company Applied Materials",2020-1-14,Financial Times,https://www.ft.com/content/c6993200-1ff3-11ea-b8a1-584213ee7b2b
