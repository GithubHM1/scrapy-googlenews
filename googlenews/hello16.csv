16 Jan 2020," for Robert Harris’s thriller, “Enigma”, is wartime Britain, where everything is rationed except for the rain. It follows Tom Jericho, a young prodigy stationed at Bletchley Park, the real-life centre of code-breaking operations, who is part of a team of cryptologists trying to break the code used by Germany’s armed forces. The work has frustration built in. Any progress can be undone if the enemy changes the code—which he will if he suspects that it has been cracked.,Your browser does not support the <audio> element.,Enjoy more audio and podcasts on, , ,or, ,.,The novel comes to mind when considering the mysteries of shifts in the economic cycle and market reactions. The mood has clearly changed for the better since the middle of last year. Fears of recession have receded. Global equity prices have rallied. Bond yields have perked up. A truce in the trade war, however fragile, has helped. But the improvement in mood coincided with signs of life in Asia’s manufacturing hubs.,The key to these coded messages is the semiconductor industry. Cars, smartphones, gadgets and cloud-computing servers rely on components, notably memory chips, that are disproportionately made in emerging Asia. The mood-sensitive parts of aggregate demand—capital spending by firms and non-essential purchases by consumers—have microchips in there somewhere. The chip industry itself has savage mini-cycles. When it turns down, it is a sign of trouble ahead in the world economy. When it perks up, as it has done recently, there is reason to be more optimistic.,The cost structure of the chip business is central to this enigma. A semiconductor fabrication plant, or fab, costs billions of dollars to build. A sudden jump in orders, such as occurred in 2017, is met with increased capacity. But when demand falls, the fabs just keep producing. They are highly automated with few staff, so running costs are low. Continuous output makes sense but leads to occasional gluts and sagging prices, as happened through most of last year. Stocks become bloated. When demand picks up again, as it did late last year, stocks are drawn down and prices begin to stabilise.,Until quite recently the industry’s rhythms, and the tautness or slackness of Asia’s supply chains in general, were dictated by the two- or three-year life-cycle of smartphones. Export orders for Taiwanese electronics, for instance, tended to spike whenever a new Apple or Galaxy handset was launched. But the smartphone market is now saturated. Consumers find that an old model works almost as well as a newer one—and this might still be the case even when the new , generation of phones reaches the market. What drives growth in demand now is cloud computing, electrification of cars, wearable gadgetry and gaming, says Shawn Kim of Morgan Stanley. The cloud is a particular force. As firms ramp up capital spending of all kinds, that in turn spurs investment in cloud capacity, where business-related software lives.,What signals should market cryptologists be looking at? One measure is exports of semiconductors from South Korea, says Alicia Garcia-Herrero, chief economist for Asia at Natixis, an investment bank, who is based in Hong Kong. South Korea is pivotal to Asia’s supply chain, she says, and its shipments of semiconductors help predict exports in the region more generally. After a brutal 2019 the trend has bottomed out and is turning (see chart). Another signal is the financial health of big Asian chip companies, such as Samsung and , Hynix. Those averse to digging deep into financial statements could simply monitor industry share prices. Or they could look for inflection points in the price of ,, a type of memory chip used to store data on servers and computers.,Technology’s share of global , will continue to grow. In principle, then, these signals will become even more closely watched. But other forces are at work. China has designs to be self-sufficient in electronic components, a goal made more urgent by the trade-tech wars. The short-term effect is to give a boost to Asia’s tech industry. But in the longer term, firms might find themselves displaced by Chinese rivals, at least in China’s own market.,To the extent that China succeeds, it will devalue the signals that arrive from the more open parts of emerging Asia. Market-watchers will come to feel the same frustration felt by Mr Harris’s fictional codebreakers at Bletchley. The codes keep changing. For now, though, the message from Asia is that the sun is peeking through the clouds—or, at least, that it has stopped raining.,This article appeared in the Finance & economics section of the print edition under the headline ""The semaphore of semis"",A daily email with the best of our journalism,Published since September 1843 to take part in, , ,Copyright © The Economist Newspaper Limited ,2021,.

08 Jan 2020,"By Hana Askren and Mark Andress,Until now, electric vehicle batteries suffered from being costly, large and inefficient. Gallium nitride (GaN) and silicon carbide (SiC) are two semiconductor technologies in the driver’s seat to change all that. ,Close-up of battery packs box in the the electric car.,The newer chemistries allow for smaller, more efficient semiconductors that can operate at higher voltages than traditional silicon wafers. Tesla’s decision to include SiC transistors in its Model 3 was seen as a big milestone for the industry. ,SiC first established itself at 1,200 volts, where it outcompetes silicon and GaN, and has moved down toward the 600 to 900 volt level to serve the EV market. GaN outcompetes silicon in the 200 to 900 volt level and is also establishing itself in the EV market. At these voltages, the technology can also be used in power electronics for solar power systems and industrial motor drives. ,With the automotive industry’s rapid pivot to electric vehicles, a slew of semiconductor startups are expected to be targeted by more-established players.,Among the most mature GaN startups are Ottawa, Ontario-based GaN Systems and El Segundo, California-based Navitas Semiconductor, whose , already have been identified in product “teardowns,” in which a device is dismantled to figure out who manufactures the parts. ,Other promising GaN startups include Ithaca, New York-based Odyssey Semiconductor and Israel’s VisIC Technologies, which are both developing high-voltage power switches and modules. El Segundo-based Efficient Power Conversion (EPC) and Goleta, California-based Transphorm, in which private equity firm KKR is an investor, are also notable GaN startups.,Meanwhile, Cree, the largest pure-play SiC company, , last year that it would invest $1 billion to expand manufacturing capacity at its Durham, North Carolina headquarters, as well to build a new fabrication facility in upstate New York. Other smaller SiC companies include Virginia-based GeneSiC Semiconductor, New Jersey-based United Silicon Carbide and New Hampshire-based GT Advanced Technologies.,Leading power semiconductor device players, which feature STMicroelectronics, Infineon Technologies, ON Semiconductor and Mitsubishi Electric, likely are all watching the upstarts. Some have already made acquisitions, as , in February 2019 when it bought Swedish SiC wafer manufacturer Norstel for $137.5 million. Other big players – such as Panasonic, ON Semiconductor, Texas Instruments and SanKen Electric – also have been developing GaN switching transistors. Expect some to switch gears with an acquisition to speed up that process, according to an industry investment banker and analyst. ,In addition to proven applications like EVs and solar panels, these devices are opening the door to whole new applications, said Craig Irwin, managing director and senior research analyst at Roth Capital, adding, “there’s a lot of blue sky out there – where else are these going to be used?” New companies are entering the market, taking on the R&D and startup risks, and could become targets once their products are established. ,There is “intense interest” in these companies for M&A and investment, and a scarcity of targets, Irwin added. Takeout valuations would have to be large in order to counter the opportunity of remaining independent and raising private capital, or pursuing an IPO.,We are a leading independent M&A media service with an unrivaled network of over 300 dedicated M&A journalists based in 65 locations across the Americas, Europe,,We are a leading independent M&A media service with an unrivaled network of over 300 dedicated M&A journalists based in 65 locations across the Americas, Europe, Asia-Pacific, the Middle-East and Africa.

            TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — South Korea can hardly compete with Taiwan in semiconductor manufacturing despite the ambitious move by Samsung Electronics to put a 3-nanometer semiconductor node into commercial production, said Taiwan’s top tech official.,
            Taiwan’s semiconductor industry had an annual output valued at NT$2.6 trillion (US$867 billion) in 2019, said Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) Minister Chen Liang-gee (陳良基) at a news conference held on Monday (Jan. 20). The output is expected to double to NT$5.2 trillion within a decade and even reach NT$6 trillion by 2030 according to an optimistic forecast, wrote ,.,
            While Samsung is striving to stay ahead of the game through the advancement of chip-making technology with strong backing from the South Korean government, it is unlikely to beat Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the world’s largest semiconductor foundry, Chen believes.,
            Taiwan’s semiconductor businesses thrive on cluster development and an “industry ecology,” as evidenced by the country's many science parks, Chen said. This provides an unrivaled competitive edge for local companies, even faced with competition from Samsung, a conglomerate which receives enormous resources from the government.,
            The island country also boasts top-notch semiconductor packaging, assembly, and testing technology which, along with heterogeneous integration and advanced process control technologies, will receive equal emphasis as Taiwan endeavors to cement its commanding position on the world’s chip manufacturing scene, Chen reckoned.,
            The establishment of a research and development center for the semiconductor sector is in the pipeline, said Chen, as part of a national strategy to promote the technology that serves as a pillar of Taiwan’s economy, wrote UDN.,Updated : 2021-08-14 19:59 GMT+08:00,Taiwan News  ©  2019 All Rights Reserved.",https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3861646,semiconductor,UK,Taiwan News,South Korea no rival to Taiwan in semiconductor industry: minister - Taiwan News

The 3D sensing market should also see better adoption in the coming year as AR/VR (augmented reality/virtual reality) and facial ID applications start to cascade into mass market models,” he said in a recent note.,Kenanga Research analyst Adrian Kok pointed out equipment maker ViTrox Corp Bhd has already experienced a surge in orders with demanding deadlines from customers in China.,“Most of the orders were placed for 3D Automated Optical Inspection (AOI) machine, as many facilities in China have yet to switch from 2D to 3D inspection. This is in line with market demand as 5G-enabled printed circuit board (PCB) requires 3D AOI to properly measure top and bottom, as well as trapezoidal sections of the PCB,” he said in a recent note.,As such, Kok recommended devising a strategy which entails taking positions in selective companies which may benefit from the adoption of 5G. Besides ViTrox, he listed Techfast Holdings Bhd as a potential beneficiary of the shift to 5G.,“We foresee OSAT (outsourced semiconductor assembly and test) players like Globetronics Technology Bhd missing out on the growth momentum even though its end customer is in the smartphone business. This is due to the fact that its main focus is on smartphone light sensors and TWS (True Wireless Stereo) gesture sensors, which do not correlate with the growth of 5G,” he observed.,AmInvestment Bank Research believes that because of Inari Amertron Bhd’s exposure to the radio frequency (RF) market, it will benefit from the transition to 5G due to increasing RF chip content per phone with every new 5G model produced. This will cushion any decline in overall smartphone sales — a matter of some concern given that global smartphone sales slid 0.4% year-on-year in 3Q19.,“Customers’ preference for mid-tier phones has led to brands strengthening entry-level and mid-tier offerings which helped Huawei, Samsung and Oppo sales grow and increase market share in 3Q19, while Apple and Xiaomi’s market share declined,” it said.,Nevertheless, MIDF Research believes that the introduction of more 5G smartphones, especially in China, is expected to lend support to the overall smartphone market in 2020. It noted, however, that the smartphone market has been contracting after peaking in 2016.,“In 2020, Apple’s entry into the 5G smartphone market could possibly stir the demand of its loyal followers and set the ceiling price for the next-generation smartphone,” it said., ,It is worth noting that the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics recently projected that annual global sales of semiconductors were expected to fall 12.8% in 2019 to US$409 billion (RM1.66 trillion) from US$468.8 billion in 2018.,It, however, forecast that global sales will increase by 5.9% and 6.3% respectively in 2020 and 2021, signalling a rebound with moderate growth.,While the global semiconductor market slumped somewhat in 2019 compared to the record sales posted in 2018, it has been reported that the recent trend is more positive, with month-on-month sales increasing in October 2019 for the fourth consecutive month.,For AmInvestment Bank, its top pick for the sector is Malaysian Pacific Industries Bhd (MPI) because of its new product portfolio that focuses on the higher-margin specialised market and its leading market position in the ultra-thin micro leadframe package.,MPI is also favoured for its increased research and development in microelectromechanical system sensors as it rides on the Internet of things wave, particularly in the automotive and industrial segments.,AmInvestment Bank has maintained its neutral outlook on the sector, considering the near-term uncertainty in orders clouding the outlook of some semiconductor companies, arising from the long-standing technology and trade spat between the US and China.,MIDF has also maintained its neutral recommendation on the sector, but expects optoelectronics and integrated circuit-logic products to lead the recovery. On the ongoing trade concerns, the research house said a prolonged trade war could lead to decoupling of supply chain apart from potential global slowdown which could affect demand.,“Note that semiconductor is a global industry. Thus, cooperation between countries would be instrumental in driving the industry.,“To maintain earnings the growth trajectory, semiconductor companies are aggressive diversifying their product and service portfolio, and expanding the customer base in the process.”,We deliver news to your inbox daily,Copyright © 1999-2021 The Edge Communications Sdn.

  A US giant has given a huge vote of confidence in Scotland’s electronic engineering expertise with plans to invest £47 million upgrading a remnant of the Silicon Glen heyday of the industry.
,
  Diodes Incorporated intends to beef up the Greenock semiconductor manufacturing plant it acquired from Texas Instruments last year under plans to make it a centre for the development of sophisticated chips.
,
  The company has won £13.7 million official support from Scottish Enterprise towards the cost of a programme that is expected to underpin the long-term future of a plant that employs 300 ,.
,
  The investment is being made despite uncertainty about ,.
,
  It will provide a huge boost for Greenock. The outlook for employment at the plant had appeared bleak after Texas Instruments announced plans in January 2016 to close the facility.
,
  ,
,
  Texas decided to move production to more modern facilities overseas, in which it expected production costs to be lower.
,
  The decision followed a long period of decline for the once mighty electronics manufacturing industry in ,. This was decimated by competition from what were regarded as low-cost economies.
,
  However, Diodes defied the view that the Greenock plant was too old and small to be able to compete in the fast-moving global market for computer chips.
,
  The company has been capitalising on strong demand for chips for use in industries ranging from mobile electronics to car production.
,
  Tim Monaghan, Diodes’ European President, said the company had made good progress at the plant since buying the facility, which is known as GFAB.
,
  He added: “With Diodes’ expertise, the high calibre of the GFAB workforce, and support from Scottish Enterprise, I am excited by the opportunity we are creating to progress even further, building on our manufacturing capabilities to create a centre of process development excellence.”
,
  After visiting the Greenock plant yesterday, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon applauded Diodes for showing faith in its Greenock workforce and underlined the wider significance of the investment.
,
  “The Scottish Enterprise funding reinforces Inverclyde’s prominence as an important area for manufacturing and ,,” she said.
,
  Scottish Enterprise chief executive Steve Dunlop said the investment Diodes plans to make in Greenock should ensure the company stays at the forefront of the industry as well as remaining an integral part of the local community.
,
  ,
,
  Inverclyde Council has provided £169,500 to support the development of the site, amid hopes other businesses will see the appeal of investing in the area.
,
  Diodes’ investment in Greenock comes after a long period of decline in Scotland’s electronics industry, which has taken a heavy toll on the Central Belt.
,
  A range of overseas corporations established manufacturing facilities in Scotland in the post war years. Many shifted production overseas or refocused on services activity amid the globalisation process which gathered pace in the 1990s.
,
  The Motorola mobile phone factory at Bathgate closed in 2001 with the loss of 3,000 jobs.
,
  US computer giant IBM operated a huge manufacturing plant at Greenock which employed 5,500 at its peak. The facility closed in 2016, 12 years after IBM sold its personal computer-making business to China’s Lenovo as it focused on technology services.
,
  Greenock businessmen Sandy and James Easdale are planning to complete a £100m development featuring homes and business facilities on the Spango Valley site, which they bought in 2018.
,
  ,
,
  The site operated by Diodes was opened by National Semiconductor in 1970. Texas Instruments bought NatSemi in 2011.
,
  With headquarters in Texas, Diodes has operations around the ,. After posting record third quarter revenues of $323m in November the company said it was well positioned to deliver profitable growth, with a focus on content gains in high-growth areas such as connected cars and high-end servers.
,
  It has other chip manufacturing operations in Lancashire and in Shanghai.
,
  The chief executive of digital technolgy sector champion ScotlandIS, Jane Morrison-Ross, said of Diodes' plans for Greenock: “Given the history of Inverclyde and the importance that companies such as IBM previously had to the region, this will no doubt create positive employment and development opportunities for the area. The investment will be a welcome boost to the economy, facilitating both skills development and new jobs.”
,
  Scottish Enterprise said it is providing a £12m research and development grant towards a five-year project to develop more technologically-advanced transistors and £1.7m towards a training programme to enable employees to support this change.

    ,Surface-emitting semiconductor lasers have been widely used in data communications, sensing, and recently in Face ID and augmented reality glasses. Here, we report the first achievement of an all-epitaxial, distributed Bragg reflector (DBR)–free electrically injected surface-emitting green laser by exploiting the photonic band edge modes formed in dislocation-free gallium nitride nanocrystal arrays, instead of using conventional DBRs. The device operates at ~523 nm and exhibits a threshold current of ~400 A/cm,, which is over one order of magnitude lower compared to previously reported blue laser diodes. Our studies open a new paradigm for developing low-threshold surface-emitting laser diodes from the ultraviolet to the deep visible (~200 to 600 nm), wherein the device performance is no longer limited by the lack of high-quality DBRs, large lattice mismatch, and substrate availability.,Vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) diodes, first presented in 1979 (,), emit a coherent optical beam vertically from the device top surface and offer a number of advantages compared to conventional edge-emitting lasers, including lower threshold (,), circular and low-divergence output beam (,), single longitudinal mode emission (,), longer lifetime (,), and easy production of dense two-dimensional (2D) arrays (,–,). Commercial VCSELs are fabricated on GaAs and InP substrates (,,,), which emit light mostly in the near-infrared wavelengths (,,,). Gallium nitride (GaN)–based semiconductors are the material of choice for lasers operating in the visible and ultraviolet (UV) spectral ranges, and substantial efforts have been devoted to developing GaN-based VCSELs in the past decade (,–,). However, the operation wavelengths have been largely limited to the blue spectral range (,–,). To date, there has been no demonstration of all-epitaxial surface-emitting laser diodes operating in the green wavelength region, to which eyes are most sensitive. To the best of our knowledge, the only previously reported room temperature continuous wave (CW) surface-emitting green laser diode relied on the use of dual dielectric distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs) and wafer bonding to a copper plate for low thermal resistance (,). The realization of a low-threshold, high-efficiency, all-epitaxial surface-emitting green laser diode will enable many exciting applications including projection displays such as pico projectors, plastic optical fiber communication, wireless communication, optical storage, smart lighting, and biosensors (,–,).,An essential component of a VCSEL is DBRs, which consist of multiple alternative layers of materials with a relatively large difference in refractive index to provide very high reflectivity. DBRs with nearly lattice matched layers can be readily formed in GaAs- and InP-based materials systems (,) but have remained a critical challenge for GaN-based materials. The large lattice mismatch between GaN and AlN (~2.5%) and between GaN and InN (~11%) (,, ,), together with the difficulty in achieving efficient p-type conduction (,), leads to GaN-based DBRs with high electrical resistivity (,), large densities of defects and dislocations (,, ,), and relatively low reflectivity. In addition, the presence of strong polarization field and the resulting quantum-confined Stark effect (QCSE) of conventional ,-plane GaN devices further reduces the rate of radiative recombination, resulting in higher threshold and instable operation (,). To address these issues, GaN-based blue VCSELs have been reported by using AlInN/GaN DBRs (,) or dual-dielectric DBRs (,) and by growing on ,-plane GaN substrate (,). The resulting devices, however, still exhibit a very large threshold current density (, > 10 kA/cm,) at room temperature, with the operation wavelengths limited to 400 to 460 nm (,, ,).,In this work, we propose and demonstrate a nanocrystal surface-emitting laser (NCSEL) diode, which is free of DBRs and can operate efficiently in the green spectrum. Schematically shown in ,, the NCSEL consists of InGaN/AlGaN nanocrystal arrays with precisely controlled size, spacing, and surface morphology. Because of the efficient strain relaxation, such nanostructures are free of dislocations (,). Multiple InGaN quantum disks are incorporated on the semipolar planes of the active region, which can significantly reduce QCSE (,). A unique AlGaN shell structure (,) is formed surrounding the active region of the NCSEL to suppress surface recombination. By exploiting the photonic band edge resonant effect of the nanocrystal array, we have demonstrated an electrically injected surface-emitting green laser diode without using conventional thick and resistive DBRs. The device operates at 523.1 nm and exhibits a low threshold current density of ~400 A/cm, and highly stable operation at room temperature. The achievement of coherent lasing oscillation is further confirmed by the far-field emission pattern and by detailed polarization measurements. This work demonstrates a viable approach to realizing high-performance surface-emitting laser diodes from the deep UV to the deep visible (~210 to 600 nm) that were previously difficult to achieve.,(,) Schematic of the InGaN nanocrystal arrays for the surface-emitting laser diode.

(,) PL spectrum of an InGaN/AlGaN calibration sample showing spontaneous green emission. a.u., arbitrary units. (, and ,) The top-view and titled-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of an InGaN nanocrystal array.,Schematically shown in , is the design of the InGaN NCSEL, which consists of an n-type GaN cladding layer (~370 nm thick), an InGaN multiple quantum disk active region, and a p-type GaN cladding layer (190 nm thick). The nanocrystals have a hexagonal shape and are arranged in a triangular lattice. The diameter and lattice constant of the nanocrystals are denoted as , and ,, respectively (,). The design and simulation, including energy band diagram and mode profile, were performed using 2D finite-element method (2D-FEM) simulation with Maxwell’s equations (see Materials and Methods, fig. S1, and text S1). Shown in ,, the reciprocal lattice of a photonic crystal structure has six equivalent Γ′ points, which are coupled together by the Bragg grating vectors, e.g., , and ,. The corresponding wavelength light can therefore form a standing wave resonant in the photonic crystal without any additional dielectric mirror (,, ,). Besides such in-plane coupling, there is also out-of-plane coupling between the six Γ′ points and the Γ point, which has zero in-plane wave vector (,). The wave vector is essentially vertical, thereby leading to surface emission (,). In this design, the nanocrystals have a spacing of ~30 nm, and the lattice constant is 250 nm.,The resulting photonic band structure for transverse magnetic (TM) polarization (, ‖ , axis) from 2D-FEM simulation is shown in ,. The Γ point in the fourth band is located at ~0.48 a/λ, which corresponds to λ ~ 520 nm. The group velocity is determined by the slope of the dispersion curve in the photonic band structure. At the band edge, the low group velocity is achieved when the slope of the dispersion curve becomes zero; i.e., near the Γ point, the group velocity of light becomes zero (, → 0), thereby leading to the formation of a stable and large single-cavity mode (,–,). The mode profile is simulated and shown in ,. The mode intensity is mostly distributed in the nanocrystals. The extremely low group velocity leads to the long interaction time between radiation field and active material and consequently gives rise to a strong gain enhancement. Photons are also confined around the active region in the vertical direction, due to the higher average refractive index in the active region. The mode intensity profile in the vertical direction is shown in fig. S1. The simulation details are described in text S1.,The realization of NCSELs requires a precise control of the nanocrystal size, spacing, and uniformity across a relatively large area. The fabrication of such nanocrystal arrays is achieved by the special technique of selective area epitaxy using plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) (see Materials and Methods, fig. S2, and text S2) (,, ,). An AlGaN shell structure was incorporated in the active region to reduce surface recombination (,, ,). , shows the photoluminescence (PL) spectrum for a calibration sample without significant photonic band edge resonant effect. The peak emission wavelength is ~523 nm. Significantly enhanced PL emission intensity was measured for the InGaN/AlGaN core-shell structure, compared to similar structures but without AlGaN shell (fig. S6 and texts S3 and S7). Shown in , are the top-view and titled-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the InGaN nanocrystals for a 6 μm by 6 μm area. The nanocrystal arrays have a triangular lattice with a pitch of 250 nm, a lateral size of 230 nm, a height of ~600 nm, and a gap between neighboring nanocrystals of ~30 nm. The nanocrystals exhibit uniform length, smooth sidewalls, and near-perfect hexagonal shape and high (depth-to-width) aspect ratio, which correlate well with the design parameters described above.,We further performed detailed structural characterization of InGaN nanocrystals using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) (see Materials and Methods, fig. S3, and text S4). We prepared a cross-sectional sample using a focused ion beam system. , shows the high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) atomic number contrast image of a representative InGaN nanocrystal. The InGaN/AlGaN heterostructures were formed as a cone shape. This is due to the formation of n-GaN nanocrystals that have a Ga polarity and pyramid-like morphology (fig. S4 and text S5). The resulting unique structure takes advantage of the semipolar effect in the active region to reduce the polarization field in GaN wurtzite structure (,). Shown in , is a high-magnification image taken from the marked region in ,. The sloping multiple quantum disk layers can be more clearly observed. The formation of multiple quantum disk heterostructures on semipolar planes of (0113) orientation is further supported by the representative selected-area electron diffraction pattern analysis (,).,(,) STEM-HAADF image of a representative core-shell InGaN/AlGaN multiple quantum disk (MQD) heterostructure nanocrystal. (,) High-magnification image taken from the region marked in (A) and (,) schematic illustration for the quasi-3D structure of the semipolar active region and selected-area electron diffraction pattern of the InGaN/AlGaN core-shell heterostructure. (,) High-magnification HAADF image of the InGaN/AlGaN quantum disk region.

(,) EDXS point analysis of the AlGaN shell region marked as “A” and “B” in (B).,From the wide-thickness layers with the bright contrast in the middle region, it can be seen that multiple quantum disk structures are formed as a cone-like shell structure (,, fig. S5, and text S6). The formation of this cone-shaped active layer is further supported by the formation of the n-GaN structure as shown in text S6. The unique 3D structure provides an emission area that is much larger than that of the typical quantum disk/dot active regions aligned vertically with the same diameter. , shows the high-magnification HAADF image of the InGaN/AlGaN active region. The presence of highly uniform multiple quantum disk layers can be identified by different contrast. No noticeable extended misfit dislocations or stacking faults were observed. The thicknesses of the InGaN disks and AlGaN barriers are ~2.5 and 1.5 nm, respectively. To further confirm elemental distribution of the active region, we performed an energy-dispersive x-ray spectrometry (EDXS) analysis along the growth direction of InGaN/AlGaN quantum disks, which is labeled with “1” in ,. The qualitative variations of In and Al across different disks and barriers are shown in ,. Because the atomic number of Al is smaller than the atomic number of In, it appears as dark contrast in the STEM image. The In signal exhibits a maximum in the bright regions and drops in the dark regions. In contrast, the Al signal shows clear peaks in the dark regions, confirming the formation of InGaN/AlGaN quantum disk heterostructures. The presence of an Al-rich AlGaN shell layer formed spontaneously on the sidewall of the InGaN quantum disk is also confirmed by the EDXS point analysis (,). The spontaneously formed AlGaN shell structure can effectively suppress nonradiative surface recombination, a primary limiting factor for the performance of conventional nanostructured devices (,). Moreover, the semipolar InGaN/AlGaN core-shell heterostructure further offers several distinct advantages, including significantly reduced polarization fields (,) and enhanced light emission efficiency (,), as well as significantly improved carrier injection efficiency (,) and luminescence efficiency (,), compared to conventional quantum disk/dot structures (fig. S6 and text S7). It is also worthwhile to mention that such a unique structure cannot be fabricated by the conventional top-down approach because the active region is predefined by the film structure.,We fabricated InGaN NCSEL diodes using planarization, polyimide passivation, contact metallization, and photolithography techniques (fig. S7 and text S8). Schematic illustration of the fabricated device is shown in ,, and an optical microscopy image of the device after metallic contact grids is also shown in the inset. Shown in , is a representative current-voltage (,-,) curve for a device with surface contact area of ~25 μm,, which shows rectification characteristics with a sharp turn-on voltage of ∼3.3 V at room temperature. The leakage current is negligible under reverse bias (,, inset). The device exhibited excellent ,-, characteristics, which is partly due to the significantly reduced defect density and enhanced dopant incorporation in nanocrystal structures (,, ,). The electroluminescence characteristics were measured under CW biasing conditions at room temperature. We collected the emitted light from the top surface of the nanocrystal (fig. S8 and text S9).,(,) Schematic illustration of the fabricated NCSEL device.

(,) Variations of spectral linewidth (FWHM, full width at half maximum). (,) Peak wavelength position measured under different injection current densities., shows the electroluminescence spectra of the nanocrystal device measured under different injection currents. At a low injection current density of ~200 A/cm,, the device exhibits a broad emission spectrum centered at ~524 nm, with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of ~30 nm, which corresponds to the spontaneous emission and may be limited by nonuniform current injection. We observed a sharp lasing peak at ~523.1-nm wavelength with increasing injection current, with a narrow linewidth of ~0.8 nm. The strong lasing spot is shown in the inset of ,, which was recorded at a current density of ~1 kA/cm,. We further measured variations of the output power versus injection current, which exhibits a clear threshold at ~400 A/cm, (,). The measured lasing threshold is significantly lower compared to previously reported GaN VCSELs (,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,). An output power of ~12 μW was measured at an injection current density of ~1 kA/cm, under CW operation. The output power shows saturation with further increasing the injection current, due to the heating effect. The measured output power is significantly higher than previously reported values of GaN-based VCSELs operating at 460 and 500 nm (,) and can be further improved by optimizing the design and fabrication process.,Variations of spectral linewidth (FWHM) and wavelength peak position are investigated under different injection current densities (,). The spectral linewidth was decreased from ~30 to 0.8 nm at the threshold. It is also seen that the lasing peak position remains nearly constant at ~523 nm above threshold, suggesting highly stable lasing of the core-shell nanocrystal lasers. The low-threshold current density and highly stable emission are directly related to the robust photonic band edge mode of nanocrystal optical cavity, the dislocation-free bottom-up nanocrystal structure, and the reduced nonradiative surface recombination and suppressed polarization field with the extended emission area in the InGaN/AlGaN cone-like shell active region.,The far-field radiation pattern of the nanocrystal laser structure was simulated using the 3D finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method, shown in , (see Materials and Methods and text S10). Because the wavelength near the Γ point has a very small in-plane wave vector component, the wave vector is expected to be almost vertical. Because of this unique property of the Γ point, the far-field pattern exhibits a spot in the center with a very small divergence angle, which corresponds to highly collimated vertical emission. The far-field patterns measured below and above threshold of the InGaN NCSEL are shown in ,, respectively (fig. S9 and text S11). Below threshold, the far-field image shows emission without any interference fringes, with the uniformity partly limited by the current spreading and injection at relatively low current densities. When the current density is above threshold, the lasing emission shows the presence of interference fringes that indicate coherent emission (,–,). Such results provide strong evidence that the coherent lasing oscillation has been achieved in InGaN nanocrystal arrays.,(,) Far-field radiation pattern of the nanocrystal laser structure simulated using the 3D FDTD method. Electroluminescence image of the far-field pattern observed below the threshold current density (200 A/cm,) (,) and slightly above the threshold current density (,) of the InGaN NCSEL recorded using a high-resolution charge-coupled device (CCD) camera above the device top surface. (,) Polarized electroluminescence spectra of the InGaN NCSEL measured under a current density of 1 kA/cm,. The polarization ratio is ~0.86. (,) The measured electroluminescence intensity as a function of the emission polarization angle (0° to 360°).,We have further studied the polarization properties in the far-field light emission of InGaN NCSELs (see Materials and Methods). The degree of polarization is defined as ρ = (, − ,)/(, + ,) (fig. S10 and text S12), where , and , are the electroluminescence emission intensity, corresponding to the electric field along the 0° and 90° direction, respectively. , shows the electroluminescence spectra measured under a current density of 1 kA/cm, for different polarizations. It is seen that the electroluminescence emission is highly polarized. The degree of polarization is as large as 0.86. Variations of electroluminescence intensity versus polarization angle (θ) are further plotted in ,, showing a high degree of polarization at θ = 0°. It is worthwhile to mention that this is a remarkably stable and directional polarized emission compared to conventional photonic crystal laser devices (,, ,). These studies also provide unambiguous evidence for the achievement of a surface-emitting laser.,A new generation of surface-emitting laser diodes using bottom-up InGaN nanocrystals has been demonstrated. The presence of a clear threshold, sharp linewidth reduction, distinct far-field emission pattern, and polarized light emission provides unambiguous evidence for the achievement of coherent lasing oscillation. Significantly, compared to the conventional GaN VCSELs, lasing and surface emission are achieved without using thick, resistive, and often heavily dislocated DBRs. This unique laser concept can be readily extended to achieve all-epitaxial, DBR-free surface-emitting laser diodes operating across the entire visible, as well as mid and deep UV wavelengths, and to realize such lasers on low-cost, large-area Si wafers. Our studies therefore open a new paradigm in the design and development of surface-emitting laser diodes, wherein the performance is no longer limited by the availability of DBRs, lattice mismatch, and substrate availability.,The band structure for nanocrystal arrays with a triangular lattice was firstly calculated by 2D-FEM simulation using the radio frequency (RF) module in the commercial software package COMSOL Multiphysics 4.3b. The refractive index of nanocrystals was assumed to be 2.56. The filling material (polyimide) between the nanocrystals has a refractive index of 1.75. The simulation was performed for a unit cell with Floquet periodic boundary condition to solve for different points in the , space. The lattice constant and nanocrystal diameter were subsequently varied to tune the Γ point of the fourth band to be ~520 nm. Then, the same lattice constant and nanocrystal diameter were used to simulate a nanocrystal array with dimensions of about 5 μm by 5 μm. The in-plane mode profile was also calculated by 2D-FEM simulation. The boundary conditions were impedance boundary conditions with a refractive index of 1.75, which is the same as the filling material. Possible modes around the Γ point of the fourth band were computed, and the one exhibiting profile that is characteristic of the Γ point was identified.,The nanocrystal arrays were grown on an n-type GaN template on a sapphire substrate by the RF plasma-assisted MBE (Veeco GENxplor) system. n-GaN:Si nanocrystal arrays were first grown with a substrate temperature of 850°C, a nitrogen flow rate of 0.4 standard cubic centimeters per minute (sccm), and a Ga beam equivalent pressure (BEP) of ~2.9 × 10, torr. The growth conditions for the vertically aligned InGaN/AlGaN quantum disk active region included a substrate temperature of 650°C, a nitrogen flow rate of 1.2 sccm, a Ga BEP in the range of 1.8 × 10, torr, an In BEP of approximately 8.1 × 10, torr, and an Al BEP in the range of 4.2 × 10, torr, respectively. For the top p-GaN:Mg nanocrystals, Mg cell temperatures of 330°C were used with a Mg BEP of ~ 1.5 × 10, torr and a nitrogen flow rate of 0.6 sccm. A forward plasma power of ~350 W was used during the full structure growth.,PL measurement was carried out using a 405-nm laser as the excitation source with a visible neutral density filter. The optical emission was spectrally resolved using a high-resolution iHR550 imaging spectrometer and detected by a high-sensitivity liquid nitrogen–cooled charge-coupled device (CCD). SEM images were taken using a FEI Inspect F50 FE-SEM system. The measurements were performed with a 90° (top view) and a 45° tilted angle from the cross section of the sample. An accelerating voltage of 10 kV was used for imaging. STEM measurement was performed using a JEOL JEM-2100F equipped with a field-emission gun with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. STEM-HAADF imaging was measured with an electron beam diameter of approximately 0.1 nm. A silicon drift detector of a 60 mm, was used for STEM-EDXS analysis.,The NCSEL devices were fabricated by the following steps. The nanocrystal arrays were first planarized by a spin-coating system using a polyimide layer, followed by O, plasma etching to expose the top surface of the nanocrystals. A SiO, passivation layer (~50 nm thick) was further deposited by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition at 300°C, and the device active region area is defined by the opening aperture on the SiO, layer. A metal electrode consisting of Ni (8 nm)/Au (8 nm) was deposited on the p-GaN top surface by an e-beam evaporator with an e-beam lithography technique and then annealed at ~550°C for 2 min in N, gas ambient. Subsequently, an 80-nm-thick indium tin oxide (ITO) layer was deposited to serve as a transparent electrode and current spreading layer. The ITO contact was also annealed at 300°C for 1 hour in vacuum. Ni (20 nm)/Au (100 nm) and Ti (20 nm)/Au (100 nm) contact layers were deposited on the surrounding ITO top surface and n-GaN template to serve as the p- and n-metal contacts, respectively. The fabricated devices with metal contacts were annealed at ~550°C for 2 min in N, gas ambient.,For electrical injection measurements, the InGaN device was placed on a motorized ,-, stage (Aerotech’s ANT130-XYULTRA), which provided precise spatial mapping. The current-voltage characteristics of the device were performed by a source meter Keithley SMU-2400. The output power was measured using a Si photodiode sensor. Electroluminescence spectra were measured by a liquid nitrogen–cooled CCD attached to an iHR550 spectrometer with 1200 grooves/mm grating. The far-field images were captured by a high megapixel color CCD camera at a distance above the top surface of the device. The polarization was resolved by a Glan-Taylor calcite polarizer (with a High-Precision Rotation Mount) installed on the top surface of the device.,Supplementary material for this article is available at ,Text S1.

            ,Intel has reclaimed the top spot in the semiconductor market from Samsung in 2019, ,.,  ,  Worldwide revenue for semiconductors, however, was only around $418 billion -- a decline of 12% from 2018, it said. ,   ,  Intel was top in 2019 revenue at around $65.8 billion, followed by Samsung's $52.2 billion. SK Hynix and Micron earned $22.4 billion and $20 billion for semiconductors, respectively, taking third and fourth place. ,   ,  Samsung had become the top vendor in worldwide semiconductor revenue ,, and again in 2018, thanks to unprecedented demand for memory chips which helped it clinch record profits during ,.,   ,  But the memory market began to face a downturn from , onwards, which saw the South Korean tech giant's annual operating profits for 2019 ,. Out of Samsung's various business, its memory business has experienced the steepest fall during this period.,   ,  ""The memory market, which accounted for 26.7% of semiconductor sales in 2019, experienced a 31.5% decline in revenue in 2019,"" said Andrew Norwood, Gartner's research vice president. ,   ,  ""Within memory, DRAM revenue declined 37.5% due to an oversupply that started at the end of 2018 and lasted throughout 2019. The oversupply was caused by a sudden fall in demand from the hyperscale market. This revealed excessive OEM inventory levels that took the first half of the year to correct. Excessive inventory at DRAM vendors in the second half of 2019 pushed pricing lower and resulted in an average selling price (ASP) decline of 47.4% in 2019,"" he added. ,   ,  Though Intel did reclaim the top spot, it also saw revenue decline of around 1% in 2019 compared to the year prior. Constrained CPU supply and the , were also reasons for the slight revenue decline, Gartner noted. ,   ,  Meanwhile, other semiconductor companies focused on memory saw drastic declines in their revenue: Samsung fell 29% from 2018, SK Hynix dropped 38%, and Micron 33%. ,   ,  ""In 2020, we expect to see semiconductor market revenue increase after the high inventory clearance to drive up the chip ASP, especially in the memory sector,"" said Norwood.  ,   ,  ""The US-China trade war seems to be easing as we move into 2020. However, during 2019, the US added several Chinese companies, including Huawei, to the Entity List restricting the sale of US components. The immediate impact was to push Huawei into looking outside the US for alternative silicon suppliers, with wholly-owned HiSilicon at the top of the list as well as alternative suppliers based in Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, and China. This will be an area to watch in 2020,"" he added.  , ,Also known as Ghost Canyon NUC 9 Extreme, the high-performance mini-PC can support up to an unlocked Core i9 processor, while the 9 Pro is Intel's first Next Unit of Computing workstation. , ,CEO Bob Swan said the chip giant is focused on 'relentless innovation'. , ,Intel Labs along with research partner QuTech at TU-Delft can now use Horse Ridge to control multiple quantum bits, or qubits. , ,Delivering mixed third quarter results, Broadcom CEO Hock Tan said the company expects semiconductor demand to remain at current levels ""due to the uncertain environment."" , ,For the full year, Samsung is expecting to post an annual total operating profit drop of 53%. ,

24 Jan 2020,"By: ,, ,After a relatively soft performance in 2018, semiconductor companies delivered significantly better results in 2019 and might be poised to extend that uptrend into 2020, especially semiconductor dividend stocks with above-average yields.
,In addition to the normal expansion of the recent demand for additional computing power driven by cloud computing, business automation and autonomous transportation, semiconductor dividend stocks could get another boost from the wider implementation of 5G networks.
,This new generation of mobile communication technology should deliver data transmission rates 10 to 100 times faster than the current 4G networks. The exponential increase in data transmission speeds should offer significant improvements in delivering voice, gaming and video streaming services. More importantly, in addition to improving the existing streaming services, the faster data transfer rates and reduced latency of the new 5G networks should also reduce some of the still existing barriers to a wider penetration of the Internet of Things (IoT).,With 5G, some of the new technologies that have been delayed by the old network’s data flow bottlenecks, such as autonomous cars, “smart” homes, instant medical diagnostics, etc., could be unleashed to deliver significant advances, as well as become less costly, which will further drive wider implementation.
,While investors have hundreds of semiconductor stocks from which to choose, the stocks listed below meet several specific criteria to ensure best chances for long-term returns. With the smallest market capitalization of more than $21 billion, the five semiconductor dividend stocks below qualify as large-cap stocks. The largest market capitalization exceeds $263 billion for an average of nearly $110 billion.
,In the technology sector known traditionally for lower-than-average dividend yields, all five stocks below exceed the sectors current 1.11% simple average yield. Additionally, three of the five companies also outperformed the 1.63% yield average of the semiconductor industry sub-segment. The yields range from 1.34% on the low end to the 4.15% on the top of the range for a simple average yield of 2.32% for all five companies.
,In addition to offering large capitalizations and above-average yields, all five stocks listed below offer positive returns over the past 12 months in a sector where one third of stocks delivered losses over the past year.
,Sorted in ascending order by their current dividend yield, below are the five semiconductor dividend stocks you should consider for your portfolio in 2020., 
,
,Headquartered in Chandler, Arizona, and founded in 1989, Microchip Technology develops, manufactures and sells semiconductor products for various embedded control applications in the American, European and Asian markets. After beginning dividend distributions in 2002, the company advanced its annual payouts rapidly. Growing at an average rate of nearly 60% per year, the annual dividend had grown 17-fold by 2008.
,In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, the dividend payout continued to rise, albeit at significantly lower average rate of approximately 1% per year. However, the overall average growth year since the initial dividend distribution is nearly 19% per year. The most recent $0.367 payout in the fourth quarter of 2019 corresponds to a $1.468 annualized distribution and 1.34% forward dividend yield which is still 21% higher than the 1.11% yield average of the overall technology sector.
,Driven by the overall market correction in late 2018, the share price dropped 40% in the year’s last quarter, which erased two years of capital gains. However, the share price reversed trend and advanced at twice the pace of that decline to recover all those losses by December 2019. The share price breached the previous high from mid-2018 and began 2020 in all-time high  territory. The Jan. 22 closing price of $109.34 was only 1.7% below the most recent all-time high of $111.21 just 10 days earlier. The rising dividend income pushed the 45%-plus asset appreciation to a total gain of 47.4% over the trailing 12-month period. The company also delivered a 70% total gain over the last three years. Furthermore, the shareholders more than doubled their investment with a total return of more than 150% over the past five years.
, 
,
,Headquartered in Irvine, California, and founded in 1962, Skyworks Solutions develops and manufactures semiconductor products, including amplifiers, antenna tuners, receivers and wireless radio integrated circuits. After peaking in March 2018, the share price lost half its value by the end of that year. After bottoming out in late-218, the share price assumed a slow general uptrend with some volatility. After taking nearly a full year to recover, the share price surged ahead in late-2019 and advanced to its new all-time high of $124.90 on Jan. 22. This closing price marked an 83% gain above the 52-week low from one year earlier.
,Skyworks Solutions did not start paying dividends until 2014. However, since introducing the income payouts, the company has boosted its annual dividend distribution every year. Over the past five years, the annual dividend payout advanced nearly four-fold, which corresponds ton average growth rate of more than 30% per year. The most recent hike for the December round of payouts increased the quarterly amount nearly 16% to $0.44 per share. This quarterly distribution converts to a $1.76 annualized payout and yields 1.41%. The 2018 share price decline limited total returns over the past three and five years to 44% and 68%, respectively. However, the timing of the 52-week low and the subsequent share price resurgence delivered a total return of nearly 80% over the past 12 months.
, 
,
,Based in Santa Clara, California, and founded in 1968, the Intel Corporation (INTC) designs and manufactures microprocessors and chipsets that send data between the microprocessor and various peripherals and accessories, as well as computer, networking and communications platforms. Despite a slight increase in volatility that included two minor declines over the last year, Intel’s stock advanced more than 25% over the trailing 12-month period.
,Intel has been distributing dividend income payments to shareholders since 1992. Over the past two decades, the company failed to hike its annual dividend only three times. Despite these three misses, the total annual payout amount rose 21-fold over the past 20 years, which is equivalent to and average annual dividend growth rate of 16.4%. The current $0.315 quarterly payout and its $1.26 annual equivalent correspond to a 2% forward dividend yield.
,This dividend yield combined with the capital gains to deliver a 28% total return over the past year. The total returns have been 73% and 81% over the past three and five years, respectively.
, 
,
,Headquartered in San Diego and founded in 1985, Qualcomm Incorporated designs, develops, manufactures, and markets digital communication products worldwide.
,Qualcomm’s current $0.62 quarterly dividend distribution corresponds to a $2.48 annualized payout amount that yields 2.7%. This current yield is more than twice the 1.11% simple yield average of the overall technology sector and 63% higher than the 1.63% yield average of the semiconductors industry segment. Since beginning dividend payouts in 2003, Qualcomm has enhanced its annual dividend amount more than 20-fold through the end of 2019, which corresponds to a 19.5% average annual growth rate over the past 17 years.
,After losing nearly a third of its value in the last quarter of 2018, Qualcomm’s share price reversed direction in January 2019. After recovering all late-2018 losses by mid-year, the share price continued to rise. The new all-time high of $95.91 in January 2020 was nearly twice the 52-week low from late-January one year earlier. The total one-year asset appreciation of more than 71% combined with dividend income payouts for a total one-year return of 76%.
, 
,
,Based in San Jose and founded in 2005 as Avago Technologies, Broadcom, Inc. designs, develops and produces a range of semiconductor devices with a focus on digital and mixed signal semiconductor based devices worldwide through four business segments — Wired Infrastructure, Wireless Communications, Enterprise Storage and Industrial & Other.
,The company’s most recent dividend hike for the December 2019 distribution boosted the quarterly payout from $2.65 in the previous period to the current $3.25 distribution amount. This new payout a $13.00 annualized dividend and a 4.15% forward dividend yield. Broadcom enhanced its annual payout mount more than eight-fold over the past five years, which corresponds to an average dividend growth rate of more than 50% per year.
,After a minor cooling off period in 2018, the share resumed its recent uptrend trajectory and gained more than 20% over the trailing 12 months. This asset appreciation and the high-yield dividend combined to reward the company’s shareholders with 25.5% total one-year returns. The share price pullback in 2018 limited the three-year returns to 74%. However, the company managed to deliver total returns of nearly 220% over the past five years.

Singapore has nearly 20 wafer fabrication plants, has more than 10 assembly and test operations, including four of the world’s top 10 outsourced semiconductor assembly and test companies, and accounts for 25% of global semiconductor equipment output.,Singapore’s electronics manufacturing has been moving towards high complexity and expertise in highly automated manufacturing, improving continuously in terms of quality and performance, enabled by the country’s outstanding infrastructure, high quality of resources and investment in technologies. Old and mature manufacturing activities have been progressively transferred out and replaced by newer activities with higher degree of technology.,Nevertheless, the country is still not without its own set of challenges. According to Jerome Roux, Executive Vice President, and Head of Sales & Marketing for Asia Pacific Region at STMicroelectronics (ST), some of the key challenges in Singapore include talent shortage and the design ecosystem., ,“Singapore’s growth and appeal to ST and other companies has led to a tighter supply of local engineers and other skilled labour,” he says. Regarding design, he notes that SMEs, in general, lack the expertise and rely very much on external design houses outside of Singapore.,To address these issues, ST offers technical support in terms of reference designs, application boards, as well as hands-on trainings to help local SMEs kick off product development.,“Through the ST Partner Program, we also qualify partners—now more than 230—with the products, skills, and resources, to supplement and extend our offer,” Roux explains. “One characteristic of the workforce profile of ST Singapore is a great mix between the very senior and experienced people and newcomers. ST has the capability to support our employees to continue to grow in their field of expertise by following and anticipating what is requested by our technology and our product and technology roadmaps. We also have the capability to support our people to grow laterally, to bring their expertise laterally to other opportunities and support functions. That's the reason why, especially here in Singapore, we have this nice profile between experienced people and newer talents. Our effort in training is quite strong but it is targeting to the company’s exact needs are for the future.”,Singapore is the sales and marketing headquarters for ST’s Asia Pacific Region. Its activities here include front-end and back-end manufacturing and testing (BEM&T), advanced IC design, packaging R&D, supply chain management, and application support. As of November 2019, the company has about 4,900 employees in Singapore.,ST is one of the leading semiconductor manufacturers working closely and in full partnership with several Singapore government agencies such as the Economic Development Board (EDB), Ministry of Manpower (MOM), and Ministry of Education (MoE), among others, to further strengthen the semiconductor ecosystem in the country.,One example is fostering talent development to encourage technology innovations and growing the talent pool in Singapore. ST has been a sponsor of FIRST (Fostering Industrial Research Success Together), an initiative of the Singapore University of Technology and Design, since the program’s inception in 2016. ST is part of the Electronics and Information Technology Academic Advisory Committee of Singapore’s Institute of Technical Education, which aims to further the development of a national curriculum on microelectronics. ST also worked with the Institute on the Work-Learn Technical Diploma (WLTD) in Microelectronics that launched in 2019, and its offices in Singapore received 13 graduates from this program.,Roux adds, “Through the ST4STEM initiative, ST is an active industry partner with the Education Career Guidance (ECG) Unit of the MoE to expose young generations to a STEM career, fostering better informed choices amongst students as well as building a widening talent pool for the continuing sustainability of the semiconductor industry.”,The global electronics manufacturing industry is currently facing a slowdown due to economic uncertainties and weaker demand from some end markets, especially consumer electronics. This is made worse by the ongoing trade dispute between the United States and China.,However, there remain bright areas of growth in the semiconductor applications sector, such as the increasing car electrification and digitalization. Autonomous vehicles (AV), for example, require around seven to 10 times more semiconductors than a conventional vehicle because the central computer has to communicate with various sensors and batteries. ,This is one of the trends that led ST to expand its wafer fabrication capabilities in Singapore last year, targeted power devices and microcontrollers for automotive, industrial, and consumer applications. The expansion marked the company’s 50th anniversary in Singapore, and further solidifies its presence and engagement in the country.,Meanwhile, Roux notes that China manufacturers’ activity transfers in South Asia to mitigate trade disputes with America should benefit South East Asia economies, in particular Vietnam, Malaysia, and Thailand, as well as Singapore for high-end manufacturing.,He says one of the trends that will greatly impact the semiconductor manufacturing industry is factory automation via advanced, additive, digital manufacturing. “An exciting contribution that ST is making here comes from our emphasis on predictive maintenance, where we offer the products and technologies that can help identify equipment maintenance issues before they cause serious problems. By improving efficiency, planning, and up-time, ST’s products and solutions are working to make manufacturers more productive,” Roux explains.,5G is another trend of interest to ST. “ST is aggressively focused on a range of communications-infrastructure-related technologies which should provide the best products and solutions for customers operating in the 5G domain,” says Roux. The company expects the market adoption of 5G will continue to bring growth opportunities in all of the end markets ST has been targeting: automotive, for V2X, infotainment and telematics, and autonomous driving applications; smart industrial applications, specifically Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT); personal electronics; and communications equipment, including 5G basestations and repeaters.,

This would enable the company to diversify its Semiconductor Revenues, which largely depend on the volatile memory markets. For perspective, Samsung’s operating profits are projected to fall by close to 40% in 2019 on account of the sharp decline in memory prices. On the other hand, the logic chip and foundry space could enable the company to post more stable semiconductor revenues and profits.

27 Jan 2020,"URL , ,Image , , ,2015-2020 period has shown decisive changes within the GaN-on-Si landscape, according to the latest report 'GaN-on-Silicon Patent-Landscape Analysis', from KnowMade, part of the Yole Group. ,In 2015, Toshiba's withdrew from the white LED market and Infineon acquired International Rectifier (IR). At that time, Toshiba and IR were leading the GaN-on-Si patent landscape, while several historical IP players including Panasonic, Sanken Electric, Toyoda Gosei, had slowed down their patenting activity.,After IR, Transphorm, Panasonic and GaN Systems started sampling and commercialising their first GaN-on-Si power devices between 2010 and 2015, a second wave of companies entered the field. These included ON Semiconductor, Dialog, Navitas, VisIC. More companies, such as STMicroelectronics, are expected soon, demonstrating the growing interest for GaN-on-Si technology in the power electronics business.,“Intel and Macom are leading the GaN-on-Si patent landscape for RF electronics applications,”says Remi Comyn, Compound Semiconductors and Electronics at KnowMade. ,Intel's RF GaN-on-Si patent portfolio mainly relates to III-N transistors used in SoC , RF switches, ultra-short channel lengths, field plates, and III-N/Silicon monolithic IC . Still, about 75 percent of Intel's portfolio are composed of pending patent applications distributed mainly between USA with 17 patents and Taiwan with 20 patents. ,Fujitsu with more than 40 patents and Macom with more than 20 patents for its side, are leading the patent landscape in terms of enforceable IP in the field of GaN-on-Si RF. Fujitsu's portfolio focused on GaN-on-Si materials, especially on buffer layers, with inventions that might be implemented on others substrates including SiC or for other applications. Likewise Intel, Fujitsu has adopted a global patenting strategy. ,In contrast Macom's portfolio is more focused on GaN-on-Si devices for RF, addressing specific technological challenges at epitaxy, device, module and package levels. For instance, a strong patenting effort was made in 2015 in order to address the parasitic channel via counter dopants in HEMT epi-structures. ,KnowMade's analysts identified more than ten related patent applications in its new GaN-on-Silicon patent analysis. Furthermore, Macom's patenting activity related to GaN-on-Si is essentially focused on US, although it has now requested foreign extensions for a significant number of newly published inventions.,Regarding power electronics, Rémi Comyn from KnowMade comments: “The growing interest in GaN-on-Si technology for power applications has not translated into a remarkable acceleration of the patenting activity. However, we observed a steady patenting activity from Infineon following IR's acquisition, and a remarkable strengthening of Transphorm's portfolio after Fujitsu's decision to transfer its power supplies businesses to the US startup”. ,Transphorm's IP position has been further reinforced following the licensing agreement established in 2014 with Furukawa Electric, a key IP player in GaN-on-Si patent landscape. Likewise, Infineon Technologies closed an important IP licensing agreement with another historical player of GaN-on-Si and power electronics patent landscapes, Panasonic. STMicroelectronics, announced in 2018 an extensive R&D program in collaboration with CEA Leti a well-positioned player in the GaN-on-Si patent landscape. ,From a technical point of view, Ezgi Dogmus, technology & market analyst Compound Semiconductors & Emerging Materials at Yole asserts: “Over the last years, in the power electronics industry, we have witnessed an increasing interest for GaN HEMTs, which bring attractive performance and cost-competitive compared to Si MOSFETs. In addition to innovative start-up companies, almost all integrated device manufacturers in the Power Electronics business propose currently GaN-on-Si devices enabling systems with higher power, higher efficiency and smaller foot print than their Si MOSFET solutions.”,In power electronic sector, GaN -on-Si devices are direct competitors of Silicon SJ MOSFETs at medium voltage. ,“SJ MOSFETS are still cost effectives and technologically interesting,” explains Elena Barbarini, Head of Department Devices at System Plus Consulting. “But the increase of players as the development of attractive performances at GaN epitaxy level drove an acceleration of available solutions. Its regards die design, driver integration and packaging.”,Another interesting application is the increasing GaN-on-Si activity within the microLED activities is step by step becoming more attractive and leads to huge volume opportunities. ,As of 2019, a significant contribution to the patenting activity (in terms of new inventions) stems from the development of a low cost and scalable GaN-on-Si nanowires-based microLED technology, which are promising for the next-generation display technology and smart lighting applications. Most microLEDs related patents included in the landscape are related to the fabrication of GaN nanostructures. ,Eric Virey, principal analyst, Technology & Market, Displays at Yole tells us the story: “The technology was first developed and patented by glō between 2010 and 2016. However, glō's patenting activity does not put the emphasis on GaN-on-Si, although it is a preferred embodiment”. ,In parallel, since 2014, CEA and Aledia started patenting their own - jointly developed - technology with numerous requests for extending its priority patents worldwide indicating a global IP strategy/competition.,In this dynamic ecosystem, GaN-on-Si technologies look attractive and promising.  ,The leading global compound semiconductor conference and exhibition will once again bring together key players from across the value chain for two-days of strategic technical sessions, dynamic talks and unrivalled networking opportunities.,Join us , on 9-10 November 2021,*, ,

28 Jan 2020," Join us for Industrial IoT Summit - a FREE Virtual event this August 23-24,The Industrial IoT Summit will highlight industry trailblazers across four tracks including: Industrial automation, IIoT, and AI; The IoT-enabled factory; Predictive maintenance & remote monitoring; and cloud & edge computing technology.,Artificial Intelligence training and inference tasks are largely being handled today in mega data centers often run by major cloud providers. In recent years, the semiconductor industry has spawned the emergence of AI chips that can work in data centers but also edge devices as diverse as assisted driving vehicles and even portable MRI machines.,Many observers believe this AI chip market is in its infancy yet is expected to explode in the next five years.,One leading analyst firm has just forecast that the market for artificial intelligence-related chips will reach nearly $129 billion in 2025, three times the nearly $43 billion market of 2018.,AI memory devices alone will account for $60 billion of that total in 2025, up from $20 billion in 2019, and processors will account for $68 billion in 2025, up from $22 billion in 2019. Those forecasts are according to IHS Markit | Technology, now part of Informa Tech. The tabulation includes semiconductors in systems that run AI functions, including the memory and processing devices within those systems that run AI applications.,“Semiconductors represent the foundation of the AI supply chain, providing the essential processing and memory capabilities required for every AI application on earth,” said Luca De Ambroggi, senior research director for AI at IHS Markit. “AI is already propelling massive demand growth for microchips.”,Major AI chip suppliers include Intel and Nvidia (and more recently Xilinx) that tend to round out their offerings with AI-related software, Ambroggi said. All the major players expect impressive growth. Intel alone said last week it had $3.8 billion in AI revenue in 2019 in a global market that it sizes at $25 billion by 2024—a figure far below the IHS Markit forecast. “The market for AI-based silicon is growing and evolving quickly,” Intel CEO Bob Swan told analysts.,RELATED: ,De Ambroggi said he looked at 50 different AI companies in reaching his forecast numbers, many that will consolidate down to 10 or so in coming years. Many are startups or non-traditional semi suppliers such as Habana, purchased late last year by Intel. Others include: Halio, Graphcore, Cambricon Technology, Cerebras, Kalray, Novumind, Thinci, Gyrfalcon Technology, Syntiant, Greenwaves, Horizon Robotics, Groq and Wave Computing.,Some of the startups are offering new architectures that challenge traditional devices used in AI processing such as microprocessors (MPUs), microcontrollers (MCUs), graphics processing units (GPUs), digital signal processors (DSPs) and field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). In fact, the use of AI in various devices means that traditional classes of processors are evolving and not easy to classify as distinct categories.,“Old definitions of what makes an MPU, DPS or MCU are beginning to blur in the AI era,” De Ambroggi said. What is arriving instead are integrated semiconductors such as application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and system-on-chip (SoC) solutions. “With processor makers offering turnkey solutions using ASICs and SoCs, it makes less difference to system designers whether their algorithm is executed on a GPU, CPU or DSP,” he said.,Much AI work requires enormous amounts of power and high-bandwidth volatile memory. To help address both demands, De Ambroggi said some of the latest technologies put the memory closer to the computational core by enabling processing parallelism with dedicated memory cells for each processing core.,Another approach is to move early stages of data computation into the memory in a technique called processing into memory (PIM). ,A third approach is using new memory technologies that allow easy back-end silicon integration or volatile performance or a non-volatile capability or fast input/output (I/O) interface or a low pico-joule per byte.,In an interview from his headquarters in Tel Aviv, Halio CEO Orr Danon said the company’s latest , uses lessons learned from neural networks in the human brain. “We have a different approach to parallelism that won’t work in a Windows computer but for a neural network with a structured, defined data flow where the data flows as in a neural network,” Danon said. “It goes back to making a processor designed for the task.”,Hailo, started in 2017 and backed by venture capital, created its processor with an integrated team of 80 engineers. Software designers sometimes worked on the hardware design and hardware designers worked on the software. The Hailo-8 is in trials with various unnamed companies that work in edge computer applications such as driving assistance, city management, security, robotics, retail, medical and industrial automation. The chip will go into mass production sometime in 2020, Danon added.,Hailo-8 features up to 26 tera operations per second. It has been benchmarked next to an Nvidia Xavier processor where it performed image classification tasks with 20 times less the power consumption of the Xavier. The Xavier took 30 watts compared to 1.5 watts on the Hailo-8, Danon said.,Hailo-8 was also selected as a CES 2020 Innovations Awards Honoree in the Embedded Technologies product category, and Hailo engineers presented at CES earlier in January. “CES was fantastic and a great opportunity,” Danon said, noting that Hailo was exposed to a crowd at CES estimated at 170,000.,De Ambroggi said Hailo’s approach to AI chips falls into a new architecture that addresses memory needs of power and performance. In the human brain, the different areas that process and memorize data are homogeneously integrated in the brain’s cortex. By comparison, microcomputers (such as GPUs) still traditionally need huge amounts of external volatile memory (SDRAM) to buffer temporary data in a data-processing job.,“The amount of level 1-2-3 cache memory is not enough to run AI algorithms,” he explained. “Consequently, new processor architectures are moving more memory closer to the various computational units to increase processing efficiency and power while optimizing data movement required during deep learning operations.”,The demands of businesses that are testing and using AI have pushed chipmakers to focus on one of two paths, he said. One is a focus on creating a flexible platform that can adjust itself to a dynamic market in rapid evolution. The other is to focus on specific applications with coprocessors and ASICs that can be optimized for that purpose.,“As of today there are enough business cases for taking both directions, all with their own advantages and challenges,” De Ambroggi said. “AI is still in its infancy. Moreover, AI grows and develops at an extremely high speed in different directions in all indu,RELATED: ,

08 Jan 2020,"Something weird is happening in the market: Transportation stocks are dead in the water as almost everything else rallies.,This pattern runs contrary to “Dow Theory,” one of the most cherished concepts in the history of investing.,Created by journalist , in the late 1800s, Dow Theory views railroads, airlines and shippers as economic indicators. Gains in those mean the business cycle is healthy, “confirming” strength in other parts of the market.,Ideally, Dow Theory prevents investors from chasing a bull market on its last legs. If transports haven’t broken out, other stocks will roll over soon enough. In recent months, it’s failed miserably. Why?,Dow Theory hasn’t worked lately because transportation stocks have their own unique problems.,Coal is the first item. It’s been one of the railroads’ biggest commodities since the 1800s, but now it’s dying. Last year coal volumes fell 9.2 percent, according to an industry group.,Even without the collapse of coal, rail traffic was down 2.8 percent. But that followed a ,, stimulated by tax cuts the previous year. Not great, but also explainable.,Next, airlines. Problems with Boeing’s (BA) 737 MAX have raised maintenance costs and congested operations. Investors also seem to doubt the industry’s ability to keep ,. There’s additional risk of higher costs for fuel and ,. Throw in ,, and it’s not the greatest combination.,Legacy delivery companies FedEx (FDX) and United Parcel Service (UPS) have also weighed on the Dow Jones Transportation Average ($DJT).

People didn’t even have telephones yet and typewriters (not the electric kind) were the equivalent of iPhones. His basic notion that certain sectors provide a clue on the bigger stock market still makes sense. Maybe we just need to reconsider which industries matter.,If Dow were alive today, he’d probably focus on ,. Microchips are used in more devices all the time — not just smart phones and computers, but also cars, machinery and appliances. In the 1800s, railroads were key to most parts of the economy. Today, it’s chips.,A modern-day Charles Dow would probably also use financials like Bank of America (BAC) and payment stocks like ,. Those sectors are completely intertwined in the business cycle and confidence.,Finally, he’d probably look at a company like ,, the parent of Google. The search giant stands at the center of the modern economy in a way 19th century railroads never dreamed of.,All those areas — chips, banks, credit cards and Internet — hit new 52-week highs since the S&P 500 broke out in October. $DJT hasn’t done that in more than a year.,In conclusion, the old link between transports and the broader market makes a lot of sense.

05 Jan 2020,"Samsung, one of the world’s largest smartphone manufacturers and continuing to work in many areas of technology, continues its efforts to become a global brand in semiconductor manufacturing. In the next 10 years, the company wants to become the world’s number one semiconductor manufacturer, surpassing the world’s most renowned semiconductor manufacturers TSMC and Intel.,According to reports, Samsung has completed a new semiconductor production. The company that produced the first 3 nm semiconductor chip prototype used a new technology to do this. This technology, called Gate All Around (GAAFET), is far more advantageous than FinFET technology, which is currently used throughout the semiconductors in the industry. GAAFET makes the total silicone size 35 percent smaller and increases power usage by 50 percent. In addition, the new technology provides a 33 percent increase in performance.,
Many industry supervisors said that GAAFET chips could not be produced before 2022, and that this technology would not be seen in any way before this year. In contrast, Samsung made prototypes of the 3 nm GAAFET chips two years earlier than expected. If Samsung already has a working 3-nm chip prototype, it means we can see this technology much sooner than expected.,Samsung’s 3 nm GAAFET prototypes started production a few years earlier than expected, which means that mass production will be early. According to reports, Samsung will start mass production of 3 nm GAAFET chips in the first half of 2021. This step will cause the 7 nm processors currently on the market to be shelved and greatly increase performance. Samsung is expected to use the 3 nm circuits it is working on in the coming years., ,

High-Temperature (HT) CVD serves the majority of mainstream silicon-based components and SiC devices… ,Although silicon is by far the most dominant substrate today with more than 80 percent market share, alternative substrates like GaAs, GaN, SiC and InP are gaining momentum within the “More than Moore” industry. ,GaN material represents the major epitaxy market after silicon substrates, mostly driven by  LED GaN-devices. However, the overall visible LED industry is currently diversifying its activities to towards more specialised UV and IR LEDs based on GaAs substrates. ,Additionally, LED manufacturers are developing new types of LEDs for consumer displays, such as miniLEDs and microLEDs. Apple is starting this with adoption in its higher-end 2021 smartwatch model. In the best case scenario, microLEDs could also spread into smartphone products, which will definitely reshape the epi-ready wafer market. ,SiC substrates have found opportunities in the power electronics market. Despite the high  price of SiC, such substrates are a strong asset for high-voltage applications, and thus are considered as a technology choice for some MOSFET and diode products. ,Looking ahead, photonics products laser diodes like VCSELs operating in the IR spectrum and typically processed on GaAs, are making inroads into the epitaxy growth market. ,With the cellphone transition from 4G to 5G, Yole expect GaAs to remain the mainstream technology for sub-6GHz instead of CMOS. It is the only technology able to meet increasing power level and linearity requirements imposed by antenna board space reductions as well as carrier aggregation and MIMO technology.,“As of today, the epitaxy growth equipment market is mainly driven by LED and power applications,” explains Amandine Pizzagalli from Yole. “In fact, massive subsidies in China have led to an excessive LED capacity build-up.  The MOCVD market is now in a situation of significant overcapacity for GaN LED production compared to what is actually produced. ,""MOCVD investment is particularly tough to forecast in the next few years and could change year to year. The situation could be reversed if the government decides to strictly prevent the major LED manufacturers from producing more GaN wafers.”,Different scenarios have been considered for the traditional LED and microLED markets in the epitaxy growth equipment for More Than Moore Devices report. ,For traditional LED GaN-based devices, the MOCVD investment trends will not follow LED wafer demand. Specific upsides and downsides with respect to LED GaN devices might arise as used to happen in the past. ,Given recent competitive trends in China, the general lighting and backlighting markets have become commoditised. Hence, epitaxy vendors do not expect significant revenue from these markets going forward. ,However, requirements for microLED epitaxy in terms of defects and homogeneity are more stringent than traditional LEDs. There are credible roadmaps for improvement in tools and equipment to reach approximately 0.1 defects/cm, or less based on defects larger than 1µm. ,Tighter operating conditions are needed in clean rooms, including for automation and wafer cleaning, compared to traditional LED manufacturing. This is especially true for the smallest dies, below <10µm, which will have smaller killer defects. ,Meanwhile, Yole says laser diodes represent an additional fast-growing opportunity as the consumer goods industry massively adopts edge-emitting lasers and VCSELs. ,The MOCVD reactor market could be affected by possible technology transitions to MBE for compound semiconductor-based devices like laser diodes, microLEDs and VCSELs. MBE could bring greater advantages in terms of yield and uniformity for VCSELs but also for high-frequency 5G RF applications. In the case of SiC power, MOCVD manufacturers are trying to identify and develop new MOCVD technologies to address the SiC market where HT CVD is mostly used. ,The leading global compound semiconductor conference and exhibition will once again bring together key players from across the value chain for two-days of strategic technical sessions, dynamic talks and unrivalled networking opportunities.,Join us , on 9-10 November 2021,*, ,

03 Jan 2020,"U.S. chipmakers wrapped up a banner year. A stupendous performance by the chipmaker industry in 2019 boosted the overall tech sector. Continued innovation in the chip-making industry last year and China's dependence on U.S.-made chips and semiconductors were pivotal in shaping up the sector’s fortunes.,The iShares PHLX Semiconductor index (SOX) rose by as much as 60.1% through 2019. The index’s rally last year was its strongest performance since 2009, mostly driven by strong chip earnings and investors' optimism over a U.S.-China trade agreement.,A reason behind China's need for U.S. technology is the country's dependency on precise U.S. semiconductor technologies for its technology-intensive supply chains and products.,For the development of China's supply chains, the country requires tools that create hardware and software that, in turn, are used in designing integrated circuits (ICs), which enable computer chips to function.,The global chip design tools industry is dominated by just four U.S.-based companies namely Synopsys, Inc., Cadence Design Systems, Inc., ANSYS, Inc. and Mentor Graphics. According to S2C data, together, these four companies control 90% of the , (as of 2018).,This dependency on top-notch U.S. semiconductor companies on China's part makes the U.S. chip industry so critical. Second, since chipmakers form the majority of prominent U.S. companies with revenue exposure to the Asian country, these have also been at the forefront of the U.S.-China trade war.,According to Evercore ISI, China was responsible for 35% of global semiconductor sales in 2018 and is the biggest market in the world for chip-enabled products.,After all, semiconductors are a crucial component of almost every vital, in-demand tech product. These chip-enabled products are part of everything, including those under the tariff fire. As a trade agreement between the two countries is imminent, the chip-making industry could definitely get a boost as demand for chip-dependent products increases in both countries.,The long-fought tariff war is finally deescalating, with the much-awaited phase-one U.S.-China trade deal set to be signed on Jan 15. This agreement is not only expected to protect U.S. intellectual property but will also allow U.S. companies to access the fast-growing China market.,We have, therefore, selected four mutual funds that carry a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and invest in companies that could gain most from the growth in semiconductor industry.

07 Jan 2020,"In the automotive industry, the easing of trade tensions and a wider recovery from customs wars will take time to materialize, and many analysts see 2020 as a transitional year. For example, the Director of Germany’s Center for Automotive Research, Professor Ferdinand Dudenhoeffer, stated, “The good news is that by 2020, the bottom will be reached, and then locomotive China will support the world market, so that the world car industry can turn back on to its growth course.”,Much of this growth will arise from the growth of the electric vehicle industry, and equipping gas models with more functionalities like collision detection systems, navigation controls and infotainment technology. Both of these trends act as drivers for the global automotive ,, which was valued at $48.13 billion in 2019 and is expected to reach $129.17 billion by 2025, equaling a CAGR of 17.9%. Safety features like ADAS (advanced driver assistance systems), LIDAR mapping technology and AI-enhanced chips that deploy airbags faster are widening the use of semiconductors under the hood. Specifically, ADAS System production is expected to grow from 54,316,000 units to 58,918,000 units in 2021, according to Mordor Intelligence. In short, end users are increasingly demanding advanced technology inside their vehicles, putting pressure on manufacturers.,The electrification of drivetrains will also lead to an expansion of semiconductor usage, which can be seen in ,. Voltage regulators and even augmented reality systems will require semiconductors. Moreover, the steady , will further increase demand for semiconductor wafers as this technology become more and more seamless.,Automotive semiconductors are a competitive marketplace with companies like STMicroelectronics, NXP Semiconductor and Infineon Technologies, but one of the most consistently rewarding opportunities for investors has been ,.,Over the last ten years, Texas Instruments has delivered a 391% return in share-price gains, with a dividend yield at 2.8%. Last year, TXN notched more than a 35% gain in share price, and over a two-year period, the company still gave shareholders a 22% increase (earnings per share have increased 18% on-average for the last three years). These increases come during a year when the semiconductor industry cooled off as trade tensions escalated and demand stalled—the company’s top-line sales fell 12% year-over-year and adjusted earnings per share fell 6%—but 2020 is looking better especially for Texas Instruments’ Analog Semiconductors division, which sells to the automotive and industrial sectors and accounts for more than 60% of the company’s revenue estimate.,Texas Instruments might be able to keep up a strong performance in 2020 as average semiconductor content per vehicle system is expected to reach new highs. Some analysts have even said semiconductor content per vehicle system will increase tenfold by 2025, according to a report from KPMG. In fact, many automakers are looking to compete directly with Tesla by pioneering new approaches to in-vehicle processing and connectivity. Many are switching their thinking from that of a car company to something more like a technology company.,“This is a revolution in thinking among the Big Three automakers (Volkswagen, Toyota and Hyundai),” said Synopsys’ Burkhard Huhnke. “It’s a question of who can shift their focus to a hardware and software stack and scale up. That is the new battle.”,At the moment, however, automakers need semiconductor makers like Texas Instruments to keep them relevant in a rapidly evolving marketplace, where the future giants of the industry are being formed.,_____,Equities Contributor: ,Source: ,

04 Jan 2020,"As reported by the , earlier this week, Samsung has succeeded in making a prototype of the first 3nm process. According to the report, Samsung's goal is to become the world's number one semiconductor manufacturer by 2030.,The 3 nm process is based around the Gate All Around (GAAFET) technology, which is different from the industry standard of FinFET. This change in technology reduces the total silicon size by 35% while taking less 50% less power as well. This allows for a 33% performance increase over the 5 nm FinFET process.,The GAAFET design differs significantly from the FinFET design, and the GAAFET design is built around having four sides of the channel which makes sure that the power leakage is reduced. This improves control over the channel, which is a fundamental step when shrinking the process node. This design allows for a more efficient transistor design paired with the overall smaller node size, which enables a tremendous jump in performance per watt over a 5 nm FinFET process.,Samsung originally stated that it would use a 4 nm GAAFET process as early as 2020, while industry watchers such as Garner vice-president Samuel Wang have been skeptical that GAAFET chips would be in mass production before 2022. However, recently Wang said that it is now looking like Samsung will bring GAAFET chips to production earlier than initially expected by industry watchers. This was initially considered extremely ambitious at the time. Still, if Samsung has a working prototype of the 3 nm process, this might indicate that the vendor might be closer than initially expected.,When Samsung originally started working on the 3 nm GAAFET process a year ago, this 3 nm GAAFET process had initially been planned to begin mass production in 2021. This comes in the wake of the 7 nm commercial peak with AMD using this process in the creation of the Ryzen 3000 series.,Stay in the loop,Straight to your inbox,Subscribe to our newsletter,For latest tech news in your inbox, once a day!",https://wccftech.com/samsung-makes-the-first-3nm-gaafet-semiconductor/,semiconductor,UK,Wccftech,Samsung Makes the First 3nm GAAFET Semiconductor! - Wccftech

16 Jan 2020," Worldwide semiconductor revenue dipped significantly in 2019 due to the global downturn in the memory market. As a result, Intel was able to slide back into the top overall spot for the first time in two years. ,According to preliminary results from research firm ,, total semiconductor revenue dipped to $418.3 billion in 2019, a slide of 11.9 percent compared to 2018. Drilling down deeper, it’s easy to see where things went off the rails.,Top 10 Semiconductor Vendors by Revenue, Worldwide, 2019 (Millions of U.S. Dollars),The memory market accounted for 26.7 percent of semiconductor sales in 2019 and as Andrew Norwood, research vice president at Gartner, points out, it experienced a 31.5 percent dip last year. In that category, revenue from DRAM dropped 37.5 percent due to the global oversupply. This cut the average selling price nearly in half – good news for consumers but very bad news for memory makers.,NAND flash didn’t experience quite as drastic of a downturn as revenue declined only 23.1 percent on the year. This segment of the market started to stabilize in July, helped out by a power outage at fabs owned by Western Digital and KIOXIA.,Samsung, which had held the number one position in 2017 and 2018 thanks to strong performance from its memory division, was unable to overcome the huge hit on the memory market and relinquished the top spot to Intel.

			Semiconductor stocks could be among the hottest stocks to buy in 2020		,Source: Shutterstock,If there’s one group of stocks that has been pretty volatile over the last year, it has to be semiconductor stocks. The chip makers have seen their fortunes rise on growing tech demand, only to see them fade away as the trade war waged on. It has truly been a wild ride for the , (NYSEArca:,) and stocks in the space.,But the new year could be full of gains for the semiconductor stocks.,For one thing, the announcement of the phase one deal between China and the U.S. is a major positive and removes arguably the biggest headache facing the sector. With the two nations now cooperating on trade, the chip makers should she their stars shine. According to the Semiconductor Industry Association, computer chips are the U.S.’s third-largest export. So, the deal is a net positive for the sector. Secondly, the semis are benefiting from rising tech adoption across all industries. With data centers, 5G and new gadgets becoming he norm even at your local burger joint, there’s plenty of runway left.,With that, semiconductor stocks could be one of the best plays for the new year. Investors looking for plenty of growth potential need to consider the major players.,Here are five semiconductor stocks that could be great picks in 2020.,It’s easy to choose sector leader , (NASDAQ:,) as a top semiconductor stock to own for the new year. That’s because NVDA continues to operate in some of the biggest trends and themes in tech. We’re talking about artificial intelligence and data center demand.,NVDA has long been a maker of graphics cards (GPUs) and processors. It turns out those chips are perfect for the rapid-fire computing power to make A.I. and data centers run fast and actually process all the needed information. After a slight slowdown — thanks to a large customer cutting spending due to the trade war — NVDA has once again started to see revenues for data center chips rise.,, NVDA saw data chip demand jump nearly 11%. Meanwhile, continued advances in conventional A.I. are set to push those revenues further over the next few years as data centers are forced to upgrade. We can’t forget Nvidia’s purchase of , (NASDAQ:,). That smart buy will add a hefty dose of interconnected technology to its offerings and make it a powerful player as overall data center demand picks up.,All of this — plus continued advances in self-driving cars and other uses for fast GPUs should help NVDA be a revenue machine over the new year. Next quarter alone, the firm expects to pull in roughly $2.95 billion in revenue, a year-over-year increase of over 34%.,It’s no wonder why the semiconductor stock recently , and new price target of over $270 per share. With so many ways to win, NVDA stock could be one of the top picks for investors.,The last few quarters have not been so kind for , (NASDAQ:,). MU makes so-called analog chips. These are the boring semiconductors that are found in countless common household items. The problem is these analog chips are so standard, they actually trade like commodities. There’s a spot market for these chips just like a bushel of corn or barrel of crude oil. Thanks to a glut of these DRAM chips, prices have plunged and its crushed Micron’s bottom line.,But these days, it’s a different story for MU and that comes courtesy of 5G.,It turns out that the ramp-up to 5G devices will require a lot of both DRAM and NAND flash memory chips — the other specialty that Micron produces. Up to 50% more NAND memory than a 4G phone and an average of ,, in fact. This is a huge tailwind for Micron and could seriously reverse its fortunes in 2020. Right now, 5G device adoption is only getting started. There’s a long runway for its chips.,Meanwhile, the semiconductor stock has continued to expand into other higher-margin specialty chips, including those perfect for autonomous cars and A.I. Those chips allowed to see a , during he last reported quarter.,In the end, Micron may finally get its mojo back as 5G and its advanced semis start to win.,Given the overall volatility of the semiconductor space, going with a proven stalwart could be the best way to play the sector in 2020. And you can’t go wrong with , (NASDAQ:,).,The beauty for TXN lies within its dual operating model. The firm is an analog chip superstar and produces tons of different basic chips for other manufacturers/end-users. Given its size, this produces plenty of cash flows for Texas Instruments — ,. And it uses those cash flows smartly to help develop other more advanced chips. These days, T.I. has its hands in everything from self-driving cars, cloud computing and internet of things (IoT) applications. These advanced and higher-margin chips have continued to provide a boost to TXN’s bottom line and balance out issues with analog chip pricing.,The balance has helped investors as well. TXN has quickly become a dividend machine. Over the last 15 years, the semiconductor stock has , That’s not a typo. Moreover, it has managed to increase its buyback programs and reduce its total share count by over 24%.,And while the issues with the trade war have hurt TXN’s revenues in the near term, the longer term is still rosy. The chipmaker recently reaffirmed its focus on higher-margin chips, manufacturing and IoT, which will benefit it over the next year or so. That could help keep its cash flows humming and its dividend growing.,With its near-3% yield, TXN could be a major bargain for the new year, especially if the volatility of the sector persists.,The new year could finally be the year that many new tech themes finally become mainstream. And that could seriously benefit Netherlands-based , (NASDAQ:,).,NXPI is all about specialty chips and specifically it dabbles in a few of the biggest tech trends of all time. We’re talking chips for automotive, IoT, mobile and communications infrastructure. NXP is one of the biggest producers of chips needed for radar systems in cars for adaptive cruise control, self-guided parking and quickly self-driving vehicles. At the same time, the firm helped create near field communication chips (NFC) that are used in mobile-to-mobile payments. Add in all its efforts to connect devices like your fridge to the web and NXPI is the leading “future” semiconductor manufacturer.,The problem for NXPI is that sales have slumped in the face of the trade war and global economic slowdown. , pretty much all segments saw a decline in revenues and the firm saw an overall profit dip.,However, with the trade war ending, management and analysts are bullish on NXPI’s prospects for the new year. Sales are expected to increase across several of its lines and the firm remains a top draw for many of the major tech trends. Meanwhile, NXPI stock can be had for a cheap 16x forward earnings and the firm continues to buyback stock and ,.,In the end, NXPI could be a top bet among the semiconductor stocks to play 2020 and the future.,The beauty of the 5G mega-trend is that there will be a lot of winners across all the equipment, devices and computing power needed to get it going. As such, , (NASDAQ:,) is one of the biggest winners among semiconductor stocks so far that could keep going in 2020.,SWKS makes all sorts of chips and RF technology products that are needed for 5G to take hold.,This includes a hefty dose of chips for smartphones. Already having a huge supply deal with , (NASDAQ:,), Skyworks is poised to make some serious bank as AAPL is set to ,. And while, SWKS does rely on Apple for about half of its revenues, it has plenty of deals with other phone makers for 5G products. Unfortunately, in the near term, many of them are Chinese manufacturers like ,, ,, , and even embattled ,. But as mentioned earlier, with the trade war thawing, SWKS could see its stars shine.,IDC estimates that total global 5G phone sales will clock in ,. And Skyworks should get some of that action. Given that its sales have suffered because of the trade war, any boost will be seen as a boon for the stock.,Now, shares of SWKs have surged this year based on this potential. However, shares of the semiconductor stock are still cheap, with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 17. That still leaves plenty of growth potential as 5G ramps up in the new year.,For investors, Skyworks could be one of the best pure 5G plays among the semiconductor stocks.,Article printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2020/01/5-semiconductor-stocks-to-buy-for-big-gains-in-2020/.,©2021 InvestorPlace Media, LLC,

09 Jan 2020,"Trojans, a dual supply chain and industry consolidation are creating new threats for chipmakers.,: Manufacturers are going to start adding , into their products, making sure they are not tampered with or cloned, or capable of being disrupted in the field. The best way to secure the supply chain is to not have security based on specific manufacturers or dependencies on specific flows, which make it hard to port the the manufacturing of a specific system from one location to another location. So streamlining the way security is added is an important step. It will make a company more agile. And in case of disruptions, we need to see more sharing of secrets up and down the supply chain. As much as everyone wants to hold onto a secret sauce, if you go too far in that direction you create a very fragile ecosystem. The key is to have more information spread around while still preserving economic benefits for individual companies.,: You’re going to have a situation where you’re not going to be able to guarantee the supply. One of the things that has to be done is to ensure where all the pieces are all the time.,: There’s actually an interesting new standards effort going on at SEMI right now around single device tracking. That’s a block chain strategy that will allow every part of the design flow to be tracked by all the relevant parties. You can see where the pieces are moving. This is outside of geopolitics, but in the end you have to assume that capitalism is going to rule the day.,: As much as it might be a single source where you a single supplier for a particular component, that’s often a profit-based motive for your going to the absolute best option. The number two option is often ‘good enough,’ and that second choice is going to be available. But you do need to have awareness of this, and be agile enough to flip to that second choice when necessary.,: In regard to the first part of the question, we are going to see more than one global supply chain. Like you mentioned with China and South Korea, these are the result of geopolitical issues that are unfolding right now. I was at a conference where a professor from Yale said he was building financial models around two supply chains to determine what the economic impact would be based on where these components or chemicals are coming from. The situation is still unfolding, but there is a real danger of having more than one global supply chain from the standpoint of trust.,: It’s important to have some of these trusted boundaries with certain applications. But another thing we realized at DARPA is that supply chains are inherently untrustable. You can’t rely on the supply chains for security. The weakest point in supply chain security is not a technology. It’s a single individual. It may be the guard or the receptionist who allows you to get access. There are all kinds of vulnerabilities, and one person can bring the whole thing down. A supply chain is not controlled by technology alone. It’s controlled by the owner of a chip. Our position from a security point of view is a traditional military type of a situation. Think about a castle with a moat, a wall and an inner chamber. We assume the enemy will cross the moat and climb over the wall, and now that they’re inside we have to protect a box in the middle of the castle. So we’ve narrowed the scope of the problem, regardless of technology and trade treaties. We’re all engineers and scientists, and we need to use our knowledge to establish a paradigm for how to secure this global supply chain.,Source:,: You’re never going to create the perfect moat or fence, and for the supply chain it’s going to be similar. We’re not going to have perfect security, but knowing when something has gone wrong allows you to try to deal with it. We need to be able to discover, possibly through traceability initiatives using blockchains, when someone has tampered with a component in supply chain. And then we need to be highly reactive to the problem.,: This is a multi-layered issue, particularly with assisted and autonomous driving. It starts at the silicon level, then goes to training for ML, and then it goes all the way up to how a systems actually works with microcontrollers and all of the electronics inside that system. The idea of putting something in silicon that gives it a unique identity that you can trust, from the manufacturing supply chain as well as its entire lifecycle, is one aspect of this. In the AI domain, if you having checked that the asset you most need to protect is in some way secured, then you need to find some way to do that. When you move into inferencing or training in AI, the attack vector and surface area increases 1,000-fold. It’s not just the keys. But now, if you are one of the Super 7 cloud companies, the other ones should not know what you are doing. So there’s a proprietary element, to this, as well. And then there are adversarial attacks on the AI. If I understand exactly the code behind the algorithm and how it is being used, like in photography, I can very easily inject the right amount of noise to create a different output. So how do you actually encrypt those things and how do you plan against those adversarial attacks in software? That is a whole new area where research is being done. We’re doing some research in this area, as well.,: The hardware-software interaction is very important. One of the best papers on this subject is ‘Seven Properties of Highly Secure Devices’ from Microsoft. There are layers here, and there’s detection alerts that are needed. ‘I’m being attacked. What are the countermeasures that I’m going to take?’ That’s a combination of hardware and software.,: The systems have grown to the point where they’re more important, and there’s more assets being put onto those systems. So now you’re trying to lock all of this down using silicon, but the surface area can be large when you do that. An SoC has a lot of portals, and as we’ve learned, you actually can attack a workstation from inside the cloud. Another area that is wide open is the flash memory. Nothing is protecting the flash memory. So you’re going to see newer evolutions in silicon technology where even the memory is protected. That’s a good place to start protecting more and more of the assets that are coming into the system.,: Hardware attacks are going after the silicon most of the time. You start with a secure element in the memory controlled by a siloed co-processor that actually implements the whole metal layer ‘kill chain.’ So when you model this, you have to model it with the understanding that you will be attacked, not that you may be attacked. Then the whole kill chain is modeled around how do you get out of it. For the typical silicon chip, you need the ability to securely boot even if you do firmware over-the-air updates where you have some malicious content or software, or you have had an attack that has infected the device. You need to be able to get it back to working condition. There are new cases that are memory-specific, where you have to discard the device. But we all have phones where we get over-the-air updates, and they have security built in so they can never be permanently infected.,: It’s a good question. Trojans are definitely real, and people don’t like to talk about them very much for obvious reasons. But we’re in increasingly perilous situations, especially with so much third-party IP popping up from all over the world. For most Trojans there is an activation and a payload. These activations can be extraordinarily long. They might take months, years before they activate. Those are very hard to detect, and maybe it’s from a company you’ve never dealt with before. One of the more interesting things I’ve seen in my short time with DARPA is that there is very little difference between a hardware Trojan and a new bug. An unintended trigger and an unintended payload is kind of like a bug. I’m encouraged to see some university research on this and EDA-types of techniques for detection of these things. We’re at the early stage of this.,: In many ways it’s not much different than what we do with test. You’re testing what you get from your supplier to see if there’s a bug in there. We probably need more sophisticated methods for testing and evaluating and determining the liability of all these components, wherever they’re coming from., ,(Note: This name will be displayed publicly),(This will not be displayed publicly) , ,

24 Jan 2020,"Sign Up to Our Free Weekly E-Brief,News: ,The epitaxy growth  equipment market for ‘More than Moore’ devices was worth nearly $940m in 2019, and is expected to exceed $6bn by 2025 (in an aggressive scenario), according to Yole Développement’s technology & market report ‘Epitaxy  Growth Equipment for More Than Moore Devices’., ,From a technical point of view, metal-organic  chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) serves most of the III-V compound  semiconductor epitaxy industry, such as gallium arsenide (GaAs)- and gallium nitride (GaN)-based  devices. High-temperature (HT) chemical vapor deposition  (CVD) serves the majority of mainstream  silicon-based components and silicon carbide (SiC) devices. ,The semiconductor industry has been  traditionally dominated by silicon substrates. Although silicon is still by far  the most dominant material (with more than 80% market share), alternative  non-silicon-based substrates like GaAs, GaN, SiC and InP (indium phosphide) are gaining  momentum within the ‘More than Moore’ industry. Indeed, new applications are  emerging along with stringent requirements where silicon solutions are not able  to provide the performance expected. Innovative substrate materials are hence  being considered by semiconductor manufacturers. ,GaN material represents the main epitaxy  market after silicon substrates, driven mostly by traditional GaN-based light-emitting diode (LED) devices.  However, the overall visible LED industry is currently diversifying towards  more specialized ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) LEDs based on GaAs substrates. Additionally, manufacturers  are developing new types of LEDs to continue creating value in consumer  displays, such as mini-LEDs and micro-LEDs. Apple is initiating this with  adoption in its higher-end 2021 smartwatch model. In the best-case scenario,  micro-LEDs could also spread into smartphone products, which will definitely  reshape the epi-ready wafer market, says Yole. ,On the other hand, wide-bandgap (WBG) materials like  SiC substrates have found opportunities in the power electronics market. Here,  power consumption reduction is required for electrification of transportation,  renewable energy, motor drives and some power supply applications. Despite the  high price of SiC, such substrates represent a strong asset for high-voltage  applications, and are thus considered to be a technology choice for some metal-oxide-semiconductor  field-effect transistor  (MOSFET) and diode products. ,Looking ahead, photonics products like vertical-cavity  surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) operating in the IR spectrum  (typically processed on GaAs) are making serious inroads into the epitaxy  market. In addition, GaAs is especially advantageous for radio-frequency (RF) products such  as small-cell implementation, for both sub-6GHz frequencies and the first  millimetre-wave (mmWave) small cells in the 28-39GHz range. With the cellphone  transition from 4G to 5G, Yole hence expects GaAs to remain the mainstream  technology for sub-6GHz frequencies instead of complementary  metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) silicon, since it is the only  technology able to meet increasing power level and linearity requirements  imposed by antenna board-space reductions as well as carrier aggregation and multiple-input  multiple-output (MIMO) technology. ,Choosing the appropriate substrate  technology will depend strongly on the technical performance associated with  device requirements, as well as the cost, notes Yole. ,“As of today, the  epitaxy growth equipment market is mainly driven by LED and power applications,”  says Amandine Pizzagalli, technology  & market analyst, Semiconductor Manufacturing, at Yole. “In fact, massive subsidies in China have led to an excessive LED  capacity build-up. The MOCVD market is now in a situation of significant  overcapacity for GaN LED production compared to what is actually produced,” he  adds. “MOCVD investment is particularly tough to forecast in the next few years  and could change year to year. The situation could be reversed if the  government decides to strictly prevent the major LED manufacturers from  producing more GaN wafers.” ,The report has therefore considered different  scenarios for the traditional LED and micro-LED markets. ,For traditional GaN-based LEDs, MOCVD  investment trends will not follow LED wafer demand. Specific upsides and  downsides with respect to GaN LEDs might arise, as used to happen in the past. ,Nevertheless, given recent competitive  trends in China, the general lighting and backlighting markets have become  commoditized. Hence, epitaxy vendors do not expect significant revenue from  these markets going forward. ,However, requirements for micro-LED  epitaxy in terms of defects and homogeneity are more stringent than for  traditional LEDs. There are credible roadmaps for improvement in tools and equipment  to reach approximately 0.1 defects/cm, or less, based on defects larger than 1µm. Tighter operating conditions are  needed in cleanrooms, including for automation and wafer cleaning, compared  with traditional LED manufacturing. This is especially true for the smallest  dies (below <10µm), which will have smaller killer defects. ,Meanwhile, laser diodes represent an  additional fast-growing opportunity as the consumer goods industry massively  adopts edge-emitting lasers and VCSELs. ,Yole notes that, for compound  semiconductor-based devices such as laser diodes, micro-LEDs and VCSELs, the  MOCVD reactor market could be affected by possible technology transitions to  molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). In fact, MBE could bring greater  advantages in terms of yield and uniformity for VCSELs as well as for  high-frequency 5G RF applications. In the case of SiC power devices, MOCVD  manufacturers are trying to identify and develop new MOCVD technologies to  address the SiC market, where HT CVD is currently predominant. ,Follow us,

16 Jan 2020,"Two-thirds of semiconductor manufacturers globally say they are likely to raise prices to pass along the added cost of tariffs to customers, according to a KPMG survey.,But a closer look at the numbers, coupled with efforts from many chip makers to mitigate trade war risks, shows that big chip players have put the trade war mostly behind them. With President Trump , Wednesday, semiconductor investors will have even more confidence tariffs won’t be much of a risk to their holdings anymore. ,Semiconductor stocks have soared in the past year, as investors looked past a 2019 revenue and earnings declines owning to an oversupply of chips in late 2018. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index SOX is up  56% in the past year, beating the S&P 500’s gain of 25.9%. Aiding the gains for chip stocks have been the ability to minimize the trade war’s negative impact and the upcoming 5G device cycle. ,Tariffs on semiconductor products finished in China add a cost to U.S. chip makers who have to import the product from China into the U.S, forcing them to either accept a thinner gross margin or raise prices, hurting demand. ,Still, the KPMG survey found that 67% of semiconductor companies expect to pass on the added cost from tariffs onto customers. The firm said 45% of companies surveyed were U.S.-based, with 32% of the companies having revenues of $1 billion or more. Forty-seven percent of respondents were C-suite executives. With respect to tariffs, just 16% of respondents said they will pass on the full cost, with 51% saying they’ll pass on some of the costs and 33% saying they won’t pass along any. ,But for the big players, price increases may be unnecessary. “Large chipmakers seem more likely to make significant operational changes,” the KPMG report said. ,Semiconductor analyst at Wedbush Securities Matt Bryson agreed. “Particularly the larger companies -- they  have multiple facilities that they’re supplying product out of that they can shift mix,” he said, meaning that large companies can shift production away from China.,Bryson explained that, when a chip is manufactured, it moves to different plants to be processed and finished before shipment to another country for its end-market buyer. Large companies are able to that ship chips into the U.S. from nations not subject to tariffs. ""If I manufacture a wafer in China and that piece is packaged in Taiwan, there’s no tariff implication,” Bryson said. ""That piece gets shipped from Taiwan into the U.S.”,KPMG noted that “moving manufacturing operations out of China is more difficult and more expensive for smaller companies without an established global supply chain."",Alliance Bernstein semiconductor analyst Stacy Rasgon agreed that smaller companies may be more at risk from the tariffs. ,Bryson noted that while many chip companies are not very public with announcing production moves, Nvidia , has made it clear to analysts that it has “fully mitigated” the supply chain risk by moving enough production out of China.,As for memory, Micron , said on its earnings call for its June quarter of 2019, it experienced a 30 basis point drag on its gross margin as a result of tariffs, but that it had mitigated 90% of the tariff impact by moving some production into Taiwan and Japan. ,Western Digital , and Seagate Technology ,, have done the same, according to Bryson.,While earnings growth now looks solid for chip makers, many of them trade at rather expensive valuations. Micron trades at 16.5 times next year’s earnings, compared to its average multiple in the past five years of 10.1. Nvidia is valued at 34 times earnings, compared with its five year average of 32. ",https://www.thestreet.com/investing/semiconductor-firms-to-pass-tariffs-on-to-customers,semiconductor,UK,TheStreet,Two-Thirds of Semiconductor Companies Plan to Pass Tariff Costs on to Customers: Survey - TheStreet
17 Jan 2020,"Semiconductor revenue fell 11.9 percent to $418.3 billion in 2019, according to preliminary results by Gartner.,
,
Intel has regained the No. 1 position in the global semiconductor market as the downturn in the memory market negatively impacted many of the top vendors, including Samsung Electronics, the No. 1 vendor by revenue in 2018 and 2017.,The memory market revenue, which accounted for 26.7 percent of semiconductor sales in 2019, fell 31.5 percent in 2019.,Within memory, DRAM revenue decreased 37.5 percent due to an oversupply that started at the end of 2018 and lasted throughout 2019. The oversupply was caused by a sudden fall in demand from the hyperscale market.,Excessive inventory at DRAM vendors in the second half of 2019 pushed pricing lower and resulted in 47.4 percent drop in the average selling price (ASP) in 2019.,Intel’s semiconductor revenue fell 0.7 percent in 2019, driven by a slowdown in the server market, an ongoing constrained CPU supply and the 4Q19 sale of its cellular modem business to Apple.,Samsung dropped to the No. 2 position due to the downturn in the memory market. Like all memory vendors, Samsung struggled with oversupply and falling prices in both the DRAM and NAND flash markets. Samsung’s memory revenue, which accounted for 82 percent of its sales, declined 34 percent in 2019.,Within the memory segment, NAND flash experienced a milder 2019 downturn than the overall memory market, with a revenue decline of 23.1 percent due to elevated levels of inventory at the end of 2018.,NAND market began to stabilise in July 2019, aided by a power outage in the fabs jointly owned by KIOXIA and Western Digital. This power outage acted as a catalyst to clean out vendor inventories and prompted prices to increase from unsustainable lower levels.,Recovery in NAND will continue in 2020 due to low supply bit growth being overwhelmed by strong demand from solid-state drive (SSD) adoption and the ramp up of 5G smartphones.,“In 2020, we expect to see semiconductor market revenue increase after the high inventory clearance to drive up the chip ASP, especially in the memory sector,” Andrew Norwood, research vice president at Gartner, said.,Hey there!,Be sure to subscribe to our daily newsletter if you want more Information Technology news!",https://infotechlead.com/networking/intel-regains-1-rank-in-semiconductor-industry-in-2019-gartner-60537,semiconductor,UK,InfotechLead.com,Intel regains #1 rank in semiconductor industry in 2019: Gartner - InfotechLead.com

 This year at CES, Seoul Semiconductor finally revealed its Micro , series products for the first time ever since the Korean LED maker announced that it has been working on the technology. LEDinside was honored to be invited to Seoul’s private show room at CES and had an interview with Sam Ryu, executive vice president of IT sales at Seoul Semiconductor to learn more about the company’s Micro LED development progress.,
 ,
 Seoul Semiconductor is a discreet company, according to Ryu, as a result, the company only unveiled its Micro LED products when they are at the stage of mass production even though it has been working on the technology and related products for years.,

 This time at CES 2020, Seoul Semiconductor demonstrated several Micro LED products that are ready to be commercialized. With its 0606 and 0404 RGB LED, Seoul marked its way leading to LED display field. And for Micro LED, the company launched 200 µm 0202 RGB LED package. The chip size has reached 2*3 mil. Furthermore, a 40 µm RGB LED package was also presented.,
 ,
 Putting micron size Micro LED chips into a package and transfer to backplanes relies on special transferring technology and fabrication process. Seoul Semiconductor has successfully developed a mass transfer technology to put Micro LED onto any kind of backplane including PCB or glass. In addition, given the tiny size of Micro LED, it would be challenging for its clients to process SMT by themselves. Thus, Seoul Semiconductor changed its business module from selling only LED components to delivering RGB LED modules to its clients.,
 ,
 Ryu mentioned that Seoul Semiconductor has entered mass production phase with its Micro LED products. With its subsidiary Seoul Viosys, they are ready to manufacture full color RGB LED chips in volume. And Seoul Semiconductor, who owns advanced packaging and mass transferring technology, is capable of providing Micro LED modules. With its proprietary technologies, Seoul Semiconductor aims to build strategic partnerships with brands and end product makers to push Micro LED display commercialization.,

23 Jan 2020,"Will a fabless approach work in the power semi market?,Several third-party foundry vendors are entering or expanding their efforts in the silicon carbide (SiC) business amid booming demand for the technology.,However, making a significant dent in the market will not be so easy for SiC foundry vendors and their customers. They are facing stiff competition from traditional SiC device vendors such as Cree, Infineon, Rohm and STMicroelectronics.,, a compound semiconductor material based on silicon and carbon, is used to make specialized power semiconductor devices for high-voltage applications like electric vehicles, power supplies, solar and trains. SiC stands out because it’s more efficient with higher breakdown voltages than traditional power semis.,In SiC, the , (IDMs) dominate the landscape. Cree, Rohm and others make devices in their own fabs and sell them under their own brand names. Those companies use proprietary processes, which enables them to differentiate their products.,The IDMs compete against each other, as well as an emerging crop of SiC fabless design houses. Fabless companies and others have their products made by a foundry vendor. SiC foundries give customers access to manufacturing capacity, but there are some cost and supply-chain challenges here. Generally, SiC IDMs don’t provide foundry services or make chips for others, but that could change one day.,The SiC foundry business is just getting off the ground. At some point, though, SiC foundries hope to replicate the successful silicon foundry model. In this model, many chip companies outsource their IC production to the silicon foundries, such as TSMC, Samsung, GlobalFoundries and UMC. These foundry vendors are not participating in SiC. Today, the SiC foundry business is still small.,As it turns out, the SiC foundry business is more difficult than the silicon foundry segment. Near term, the SiC foundry business will resemble other power semi markets. The best example is the , (IGBT) segment, a power semi type that competes against SiC devices.,“When you’re talking about the silicon foundry model, it is very successful,” said Hong Lin, an analyst at Yole Développement. “I am not here to say there is no chance for the foundry model in silicon carbide. In the power semiconductor business, if we’re looking at today’s IGBTs designs, there are foundries here. But it’s more of an IDM business.”,Still, the industry needs to keep an eye on the events in the arena. Among them:,
In total, the SiC device business grew from $420 million in 2018 to $564 million in 2019, according to Yole. The big growth driver is battery-electric cars. Power supplies and solar are also strong markets.,“In our forecast, there is still growth in 2020,” Yole’s Lin said. “If we look at the five-year CAGR, it’s close to 30%. If we look at this year, there are some products that will continue to ramp up. But the real ramp up, in particular with the automotive market, is later. It’s not in 2020.,“There is no doubting the technical benefits of using wide band-gap instead of silicon-based technology for different inverters and converters for EV/HEV,” Lin said. “R&D programs and technical developments have shown positive results, including reduction in size and weight and efficiency improvements for both SiC and GaN.”,
,SiC is also competitive. Nearly two-dozen SiC device suppliers compete in the business. “The market is still very nascent. We are still in the phase that we are seeing more and more companies here. We may see it go towards a consolidation phase,” Lin said. “It’s premature to predict if the fabless companies will be successful or not. Today, it’s too early to tell.”,SiC power semis are one of many types of power devices in the market. Power semis are specialized transistors that operate as a switch. They allow the power to flow in the “on” state and stop it in the “off” state. These devices boost the efficiencies and minimize the energy losses in systems.,For years, the power semi market has been dominated by silicon-based devices, namely power MOSFETs and IGBTs. , are used in applications up to 900 volts. These include adapters and power supplies. The term “volts” denotes the maximum allowed operating voltage in the device.,IGBTs are used in midrange applications from 400 volts to 10 kilovolts. IGBTs are used in automotive, industrial and other applications.,Both power MOSFETs and IGBTs are mature and inexpensive, but they are also reaching their theoretical limits. That’s where SiC and , (GaN) fit in. Both GaN and SiC are wide-bandgap technologies, meaning they are more efficient than silicon-based devices. For example, compared to silicon, SiC has 10 times the breakdown field strength and 3 times the thermal conductivity.,“SiC and GaN are promising components for the power semiconductor market due to the higher efficiency and smaller form factor characteristics compared to their silicon-based peers like power MOSFETs and IGBTs” said Steven Liu, vice president of corporate marketing at ,. “The devices can be made much smaller in size for the same relative voltage and current handling capability. GaN has made inroads in applications requiring 600 volts and below, while SiC has made inroads in applications requiring 1,200 volts and above.”,Device makers sell SiC power MOSFETs and diodes, which are used in 600-volt to 10-kilovolt applications. A SiC power MOSFET is a power switching transistor. A diode is a device that passes electricity in one direction and blocks it in the opposite direction.,The downside with SiC is cost. The devices are more expensive than power MOSFETs and IGBTs.,
Power semis are different than digital CMOS chips. They can withstand high voltages and large currents in systems.,In ,, chip suppliers put an emphasis on IC design to differentiate their products. Many chip suppliers also outsource some or all of their production to silicon foundries. Foundries develop a baseline process and customers design a chip around it.,The power semi segment is different. “Many foundries provide MOSFET/IGBT production services to customers, including UMC,” UMC’s Liu said. “However, IDMs still continue to dominate discrete ICs in terms of shipment volume.”,Generally, in power discretes, the foundry doesn’t develop a baseline process. Instead, a fabless design house develops a device based on the company’s proprietary process. Then, the process from the fabless company is ported to a foundry.,Each fabless customer may have a different process. So the foundry must port and maintain different processes for numerous customers.,“That flies in the face of the normal foundry model. That’s how you get your high volume and cost savings by running a single process that everybody designs into. It’s just different masks and ways to wire up a circuit,” said John Palmour, CTO of power and RF at Cree. “That doesn’t work for power devices. I’m not saying that a foundry model won’t work. They are doing business. But the big guys in silicon carbide do not use foundries. They all use their own fabs.”,There are several reasons for this. In simple terms, a given device is developed and optimized around a process under one roof in the fab. The device and process are tightly coupled in the fab. So the emphasis is developing a proprietary process, as opposed to IC design. In effect, design and process are one and the same.,“In other words, you can’t just draw up a power MOSFET, throw it over and say print this,” Palmour said. “The reason is that there is no circuit design. You can’t differentiate yourself from your competitor with circuit design because there’s no circuit. It’s one big device. The product that you sell is actually the process. Your design is entirely dependent on the process and vice versa. And that’s how you differentiate yourself from your competitor.”,So a SiC power device isn’t exactly a circuit from a traditional standpoint. “It’s a bunch of little discrete MOSFETs all tied in parallel,” Palmour said. “Think of it as one of the bits in CMOS. You’re going to design your own bit and then you’re going to parallel 500,000 of them. It’s not a standard process. But you are changing the fundamental structure between every customer.”,All told, the IDM model works for SiC. The SiC market is dominated by several IDMs, such as Cree, Infineon, On Semiconductor, STMicroelectronics, Rohm, Toshiba and others.,Not all IDMs are alike. A few are vertically integrated. For example, Cree makes its own SiC substrates. It not only uses the substrates for its own products, but it also sells them to competitors. In addition, Cree fabricates and sells SiC devices to customers.,Rohm and STMicroelectronics are also vertically integrated. Integrated suppliers can control the supply chain, enabling them to quickly react to the demand cycles.,Most IDMs aren’t vertically integrated. Most are buying the substrates from Cree, Rohm or third-party suppliers.,For all vendors, though, there are several manufacturing challenges in SiC. In the SiC flow, a vendor obtains a SiC wafer, which is then processed in a 100mm (4-inch) or 150mm (6-inch) fab. This, in turn, creates a SiC power device.,The biggest challenge is the SiC substrate. It’s too expensive, which drives up the cost for SiC power devices. “One of the key challenges we see in the SiC market today is securing high quality substrates for any company’s production plans at a price that makes sense,” said Mukund Raghunathan, product marketing manager at ,.,The SiC substrate production process is complex. It starts with silicon and carbon materials, which are inserted in a crucible. In the crucible, a boule is formed and then sliced into SiC substrates.,“There are challenges associated with SiC as it has proved difficult to handle, grind and saw, compared to silicon,” said Rich Rice, senior vice president of business development at ASE.,During this or other processes, the SiC substrates are prone to various defect types. “Most of the challenges are related to the quality of the SiC material,” said Llewellyn Vaughan-Edmunds, director of strategic marketing at ,. “Killer defects such as basal plane defects as well as general defects such as threading screw dislocations need to be reduced.”,Following the SiC wafer process, an epi layer is grown on the substrate. Then the wafer is processed in the fab, resulting in a SiC device.,SiC MOSFETs are based on two structure types—planar and trench. Planar incorporates a traditional source-gate-drain structure. Trench forms a “U shape” vertical gate channel.,“Turning to wafer processing and plasma etch, there are two choices in trench profile when it comes to non-planar SiC devices. Users ask for trenches with no micro-trenching (flat base) or bottom rounding (test tube shape). Whichever profile is used, end-pointing is desirable to stop the etch front at the right depth,” said Kevin Crofton, president of SPTS and senior vice president at KLA. “For SiC devices, conducting film deposition by , is very similar to that used in the silicon MOSFET lines. In both applications, the device makers want to deposit thick (4-microns plus) aluminum alloys with no defects. One of the challenges is to deposit these films at a high rate without whiskers. Another challenge is to track and align the transparent wafers around the wafer processing system, particularly with legacy hardware.”,The SiC industry requires some breakthroughs. “Today, the substrate costs are approximately 50% of the processed wafer. The goal and focus in the industry are to reduce this cost and increase the supply, while also improving quality,” Vaughan-Edmunds said. “Therefore, new ways to speed up the growth of SiC boules, improve uniformity, enable faster slicing and high-precision CMP are a big focus.”,Others agree. “Despite the considerable focus on expanding the commercialization of SiC, it is still immature compared to silicon-based IGBT technologies,” said David Haynes, managing director of strategic marketing at ,. “This is particularly true in automotive applications where reliability is critical and product certification can be complex and time-consuming. To close this gap and accelerate adoption, a holistic understanding of defectivity in SiC device fabrication is required.”,
Meanwhile, customers can buy SiC devices from IDMs and fabless companies. As stated, fabless companies and others use foundries.,In CMOS, this relationship is often referred to as the fabless-foundry model. This model was first introduced in the 1980s, but was quickly dismissed. Later, though, it proved to be a big success.,The SiC fabless-foundry model is relatively new, and it comes with an assortment of challenges. While IDMs will continue to dominate, there is also room for the fabless and foundry vendors. In fact, several fabless companies already are ramping up products using foundries.,“The fabless model allows startups and smaller companies to test their products without significant process equipment investment,” KLA’s Raghunathan said. “Conversely, traditional fabs retain the advantage of being the strategic vendor of choice for major customers. Both models are playing to their respective strengths, serving the varied needs of the current industry landscape and finding ways to coexist.”,Over the years, a few vendors provided SiC foundry services. But the big effort started in 2015, when the U.S. Department of Energy and North Carolina State University formed PowerAmerica, a partnership between industry, government, national labs and academia. PowerAmerica’s goal is to accelerate the commercialization of GaN and SiC.,As part of its efforts, PowerAmerica in 2016 provided support for X-Fab, which was (and still is) developing a SiC foundry service in its 150mm fab in Texas. Working with PowerAmerica, X-Fab devised process kits and other technologies for making SiC devices.,Others are developing similar services. Episil is in the process of transforming its SiC foundry fab from 100mm to 150mm. And Sanan launched a 150mm SiC foundry service.,Still others are exploring the business. “More and more foundry players are now interested to be involved in this market,” UMC’s Liu said.,Today, X-Fab is in production with several SiC customers. But bringing up a SiC foundry business presents some challenges. “Investments need to be made to support the business considerably in advance of volume production,” said Christopher Toelle, business unit manager at X-Fab. “Creating the right foundry infrastructure to align to the needs of SiC power customers is also important.”,According to Toelle, here are the other challenges in the arena:,Despite the challenges, several SiC device suppliers are producing products using foundries. These suppliers include ABB, GeneSiC, Global Power, Microchip, Monolith, and UnitedSiC.,It makes sense to have a fab. But it doesn’t make economic sense to have a fab unless you can process from 10,000 to 30,000 SiC wafers a month, according to UnitedSiC.,Only a few vendors are producing devices at those volumes. If not, it makes sense to use foundries. “The reason for going down this path is that it’s really the most capital efficient way to build a semiconductor business,” said Chris Dries, president and CEO at UnitedSiC, a fabless SiC device supplier. UnitedSiC has its 150mm products made by X-Fab. It also uses an undisclosed vendor for 100mm capacity.,Having a foundry is only part of the equation. “If we were just to make a ‘me too’ MOSFET, we wouldn’t be competitive. As a fabless company, you have to buy a substrate and get epi put on it. Then, you need a foundry and a packaging house,” Dries said. “How do we as a fabless company compete against the larger vertically integrated competitors? You have to out innovate your vertically integrated competitors. That’s exactly what we’ve done. We have the lowest specific on-resistance devices in the world today.”,UnitedSiC sells several products, including SiC junction gate FETs (JFETs). “We make normally-on JFETs, and then cascode them with low-voltage silicon MOSFETs. It’s more of a composite device,” he said.,Still, some customers may be skittish in dealing with a fabless company. To help matters, UnitedSiC has strong backing. ADI has invested in UnitedSiC and has a supply agreement with the company.,But it won’t be easy to compete against IDMs. Process costs are high. “Trying to compete on price with the IDMs is nearly impossible,” according to one expert.,There are other hurdles. In CMOS, many IDMs stopped building advanced fabs because they became too expensive. Instead, many IDMs decided to outsource some or part of their production to foundries.,It’s unclear if the outsourcing model will work for SiC IDMs. “They already have huge, fully depreciated fabs. They want to put stuff in their own factories and leverage the volumes. They have no motivation to use a foundry,” Cree’s Palmour said.,
Clearly, SiC is a hot market, thanks to potential demand from the electric vehicle market. This in turn has attracted a growing number of new players, including device makers and foundries.,But it’s unclear if there is room for everyone. It’s highly doubtful, even if the market takes off in a big way., ,Very good SiC market analysis report.

17 Jan 2020,"According to researchers at Northwestern University and Argonne National Laboratory, the new material could be integrated into a handheld device for field inspections or incorporated into current wall-sized devices that monitor trucks for radioactive contraband. The study appears in ,.,“People have imagined semiconductor neutron detectors for a long time,” said Northwestern’s Mercouri Kanatzidis, who led the research. “The idea was there, but no one had the right material to do it.”,Heavy elements like uranium and plutonium eject neutrons from their nuclei as they decay. Most neutron detectors are scintillators that sense ejected neutrons and emit light to alert the user. In contrast, the new material detects electrical signals induced by the neutrons.,Lithium has been touted as a promising material for neutron detecting devices as it is excellent at absorbing neutrons but integrating the element into a semiconductor and making it stable has presented challenges.,“You can find good semiconductors, but they don’t have lithium,” Kanatzidis said in a statement. “Or you can find stable lithium compounds that are not good semiconductors. We found the best of both worlds. The specific lithium-6 isotope, which is reasonably abundant and low cost, is a strong neutron absorber.”,In their study, Kanatzidis and his team discovered the right combination of materials to make a working device that also keeps lithium stable. Their new material – lithium-indium-phosphorous-selenium – is layered in structure and enriched with the lithium-6 isotope.,“The crystal structure is special,” Kanatzidis said. “The lithium is inside the layers, so water cannot reach it. That’s a big, important feature of this material.”,The resulting semiconductor neutron detector can very rapidly detect thermal neutrons from even a very weak source. The team said it can also discriminate between neutrons and other types of nuclear signals, such as gamma rays, thereby preventing false alarms.,The material also contains a very high amount of lithium, so a smaller fraction of the material can absorb the same amounts of neutrons as a very large device, leading to devices small enough to fit in a person’s hand.,“It’s important to have all sizes of neutron detectors and as many kinds as possible, such as our new semiconductor,” Kanatzidis said. “You want ones that are as big as a wall, where you can pass a truck right by it. But you also want small ones that can be portable for inspections out in the field.”,Visit the UK’s dedicated jobsite for engineering professionals.

16 Jan 2020,"Sign Up to Our Free Weekly E-Brief,News: ,Researchers in the UK, Spain and Portugal  have found that two-dimensional (2D) indium selenide (InSe) has infrared  emissions that are preferentially in-plane, which could expand the capabilities  of 2D optoelectronics [Mauro Brotons-Gisbert et al, Nature Communications,  vol10, p3913, 2019].,The team from Heriot-Watt University in the  UK, Universidad de Valencia in Spain and International Iberian Nanotechnology  Laboratory (INL) in Portugal attribute the emission to excitons – bound  electron-hole pairs – with a dipole moment directed out-of-plane (OP).,Other 2D semiconductors such as the  transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) tend to have excitons with the dipole  direct in-plane (IP) with emission directed out of the plane of the  semiconductor. The transition metals used include molybdenum (Mo) and tungsten (W),  combined with two chalcogenide atoms such as selenium (Se) or sulfur (S). Other  2D materials with in-plane dipoles include black phosphorus and cadmium  selenide.,
        ,
        The in-plane dipole orientation is  desirable for out-coupling radiation through vertical structures. However, for  in-plane photonic waveguide circuits, the out-of-plane orientation is more  useful. The researchers also say that “out-of-plane dipoles present higher  Purcell enhancements and couple more efficiently than in-plane ones to multimode  cylindrical waveguides and optical fibers when placed in the vicinity of the  waveguides.” Purcell enhancement refers to increased spontaneous emission rates  due to environmental effects, such as being placed in a resonant cavity.,The 2D nature of these materials is  achieved by moving from bulk material to progressively thinner layers down to a  monolayer (ML). The potential for 2D optoelectronic structures arises because  of strong in-plane bonding combined with weaker van der Waals bonding between  layers.,The researchers comment: “The orbital  nature of the electronic states at the bandgap edges makes 2D InSe a valuable  building block in the design of van der Waals heterostructures with tailored  optoelectronic properties. On the one hand, the strong p, orbital nature of the  top valence band endows InSe with one of the largest bandgap tunability ranges  found in a 2D semiconductor when its thickness varies between the bulk and the  ML. On the other hand, electronic states of p, orbital nature are even under mirror symmetry  operation; combining these states with the odd symmetry of the bottom of the  conduction band determines the out-of-plane orientation of the luminescent  excitons in this 2D semiconductor.” ,Study of the polarization and  directionality of the light from photoluminescence (PL) on a thick 90nm InSe  layer showed exciton emissions with an out-of-plane dipole distribution of 97%  (Figure 1). The substrate for the experiment was a 105nm silicon dioxide (SiO,) layer on silicon. Reducing  the flake thickness to 8nm (around 10 monolayers), 2D InSe demonstrated an out-of-plane  distribution of 95% (Figure 2). Compared with the 90nm flake, there was a  blue-shift in the emission of 5meV from 1.244eV. The blue-shift is attributed  to the 2D quantum confinement increasing the effective bandgap.,The researchers also studied MoSe, and WSe,, since there was the  possibility of ‘grey’ in-plane excitons with state splitting leading to allowed  and forbidden transitions. The researchers comment: “Low-temperature PL  measurements of ML WSe, and WS, with  high NA [numerical aperture] objectives have shown that grey excitons  contribute significantly to the emitted PL signal, making the low-temperature  PL of these semiconductors originating not exclusively from in-plane dipoles  but from a combination of in-plane and out-of-plane dipoles. However, a  quantitative and unambiguous determination of the contribution of the grey  excitons to the room-temperature PL of W-based TMDs is still missing.” ,The team’s experimental work suggests that  the in-plane contribution at room temperature is in fact 100% for WSe,.,The researchers see themselves as part of  the European ‘Quantum Flagship’ project. The Valencia participants are part of  the Instituto de Ciencia de Materiales (ICMUV), which is advancing a ‘Scalable  Two-Dimensional Quantum Integrated Photonics’ (S2QUIP) venture with the aim of  developing “circuits of quantic photonics by integrating two-dimensional  semiconductor materials that are compatible with CMOS technology, often used  when manufacturing traditional integrated circuits”. Such work could also lead  to progress towards quantum information processing., , , , ,Follow us,

14 Jan 2020,"URL , ,Image , ,Striving for SiC market domination, STMicroelectronics has closed its deal to acquire SiC wafer maker, Norstel. Where next for Europe's biggest-earning chip maker, asks Rebecca Pool. ,In an ongoing bid to bolster its SiC supply chain, STMicroelectronics closed its deal to acquire Sweden-based SiC wafer manufacturer, Norstel, in December last year. All in all, the Switzerland-based chip maker paid $137.5 million for Norstel, a move that follows a string of SiC agreements in 2019.,In January 2019, ST signed a $250 million, multi-year deal with Cree to source its 150 mm bare and epitaxial wafers, and one month later revealed it had acquired a majority stake in Norstel. Then come November, it extended its Cree wafer deal to more than $500 million, just before detailing plans to buy the remainder of Norstel.,As Marco Monti, President of STMicroelectronics Automotive and Discrete Group, says: “ST has made clear its ambition to continue to lead in the market for SiC, and this requires full flexibility in our wafer supply chain.”,“The Norstel acquisition and wafer supply agreements keep us on track to secure the SiC wafers we require to meet the demand for SiC MOSFETs and diodes for automotive and industrial customer programmes that will ramp up in the coming years,” he adds.,In addition, investments in a 300 mm power technologies fab in Agate, Italy, hold promise for future SiC capacity increases. And across results briefings, Jean-Marc Chery, president and chief executive of ST has outlined plans to capture at least a 30% slice of a total market that which could top $3 billion by 2025.,As part of these plans, ST will now fully integrate Norstel's Norrköping facility into its operations. With this, ST intends to ramp up production of 150 mm SiC wafers as well as increase research and development activities on 200 mm wafer production. ,“We also expect [Norstel's] facility to contribute to our broader efforts on wide bandgap materials,” highlights Monti. “We won't discuss our capacity or how much [capacity] this facility adds, but our overall capacity is fully in line with today's demands and will support our ambitions to continue to lead the SiC market.”,“Activity on 200 mm R&D wafer preparation has already started and we intend to be ready with the technology when the market requires wafer migration,” he adds. “The Norstel acquisition boosts our flexibility, allowing us to better control improvements in yield and wafer quality, as well as support our long-term SiC roadmap and business.”,Without a doubt, automotive markets are a huge draw for any wide bandgap semiconductor player. In the last two to three years, auto-manufacturer investments in electric vehicles have been gathering momentum reaching hundreds of billions of dollars and increasingly driving demand for SiC.,Cree chief executive, Gregg Lowe, has largely attributed his company's massive SiC  investments to anticipated demand from vehicle manufacturers. Indeed, alongside Infineon and Osram, Cree recently joined the Volkswagon Group's 'Future Automotive Supply Tracks' Initiative to drive vehicle projects forward.,Meanwhile, ST has won design-in contracts with key automotive players for its microcontrollers in electric vehicle charging adapters and communications systems.,Still as Monti points out: “While automotive markets get much of the attention for SiC MOSFETs and diodes, we also see significant opportunity for SiC, and GaN, in high-end industrial applications, including power supplies, renewable generation and industrial motor drives.”,“We already have many customers in industrial applications... and technology proliferation  and improved affordability will make [SiC] a winning technology for high power applications greater than 650V,” he adds.,But what about recent issues with China? Ongoing political tensions aside, a softening in demand for electric vehicles from the nation, following cuts in government subsidies, could weaken demand for SiC in the short term.

To learn more, read our Privacy Policy., Moore's Law that's obvious to anyone, it's that transistors have been made smaller and smaller as the years went on. Scientists and engineers have taken that trend to an almost absurd limit during the past decade, creating devices that are made of one-atom-thick layers of material.,The most famous of these materials is, of course, ,, a hexagonal honeycomb-shaped sheet of carbon with outstanding conductivity for both heat and electricity, odd optical abilities, and incredible mechanical strength. But as a substance with which to make transistors, graphene hasn't really delivered. With no natural bandgap—the property that makes a semiconductor a semiconductor—it's just not built for the job.,Instead, scientists and engineers have been exploring the universe of transition metal dichalcogenides, which all have the chemical formula MX2. These are made up of one of more than a dozen transition metals (M) along with one of the three chalcogenides (X): sulfur, selenium, or tellurium. Tungsten disulfide, molybdenum diselenide, and a few others can be made in single-atom layers that (unlike graphene) are natural semiconductors. These materials offer the enticing prospect that we will be able to scale down transistors all the way to atom-thin components long after today's silicon technology has run its course.,While this idea is really exciting, I and my colleagues at , believe 2D materials could actually show up much sooner, even while silicon still remains king. We've been developing a technology that could put 2D semiconductors to work in silicon chips, enhancing their abilities and simplifying their designs., are worth all the scientific and engineering work we and other researchers around the world have put into them because they could eliminate one of the biggest problems with today's transistors. The issue, the result of what are called short-channel effects, is a consequence of the continual shrinking of the transistor over the decades.,A metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET), the type of device in all digital things, is made up of five basic parts: The source and drain electrodes; the channel region that connects them; the gate dielectric, which covers the channel on one or more sides; and the gate electrode, which contacts the dielectric. Applying a voltage at the gate relative to the source creates a layer of mobile charge carriers in the channel region that forms a conductive bridge between the source and drain, allowing current to flow.,But as the channel was made smaller and smaller, current would increasingly leak across it even when there was no voltage on the gate, wasting power. The change from the planar designs of the 20th century to the , transistor structure used in today's most advanced processors was an attempt to counter this important short-channel effect by making the channel region thinner and having the gate surround it on more sides. The resulting fin-shaped structure provides better electrostatic control. (The coming move to the nanosheet transistor is a furthering of this same idea. See “,,"" ,, August 2019.),Certain 2D semiconductors could circumvent short-channel effects, we think, by replacing the silicon in the device channel. A 2D semiconductor provides a very thin channel region—as thin as a single atom if only one layer of semiconductor is used. With such a restricted pathway for current to flow, there is little opportunity for charge carriers to sneak across when the device is meant to be off. That means the transistor could continue to be shrunk down further with less worry about the consequences of short-channel effects.,These 2D materials are not only useful as semiconductors, though. Some, such as hexagonal boron nitride, can act as gate dielectrics, having a dielectric constant similar to that of silicon dioxide, which was routinely used for that job until about a decade ago. Add graphene in place of the transistor's metal parts and you've got a combination of 2D materials that forms a complete transistor. Indeed, ,. While these prototypes were much larger, you could imagine scaling them down to the size of just a few nanometers.,As amazing as an all-2D transistor that's a fraction of the size of today's devices might be, that won't be the first implementation of 2D materials in electronic circuits. Instead, 2D materials will probably arrive in low-power circuits that have more relaxed performance requirements and area constraints.,The set of circuits we're targeting at Imec are built in the so-called back-end-of-line. Chipmaking is divided into two parts: the front-end-of-line part consists of processes—many of them requiring high temperatures—that alter the silicon itself, such as implanting dopants to define the parts of a transistor. The back-end-of-line part builds the many layers of interconnects that link the transistors to form circuits and deliver power.,With traditional transistor scaling becoming more and more difficult, engineers have been looking for ways to add functionality to the interconnect layers. You can't do this simply by using ordinary silicon processes because the heat involved would damage the devices and interconnects beneath them. So, many of these schemes rely on materials that can be made into devices at relatively low temperatures.,
,
,A specific advantage of using 2D semiconductors instead of some other candidates is the potential ability to build both ,-type (carrying positive charges) and ,-type (carrying electrons) devices, a necessity in CMOS logic. CMOS circuits are the backbone of today's logic because, ideally, they consume power only when switching from one state to the other. In our preferred 2D semiconductor, we've demonstrated ,-type transistors but not yet ,-type. However, the physics underlying these materials strongly suggests we can get there through engineering the dielectrics and metals that contact the semiconductor.,Being able to produce both ,- and ,-type devices would allow the development of compact back-end logic circuits such as repeaters. Repeaters essentially relay data that must travel relatively far across a chip. Ordinarily, the transistors involved reside on the silicon, but that means signals must climb up the stack of interconnects until they reach a layer where they can travel part of the distance to their destination, then go back down to the silicon to be repeated and up again to the long-distance interconnect layer. It's a bit like having to exit the highway and drive into the center of a crowded city to buy petrol before getting back on the highway.,A repeater up near the long-distance interconnect layer is more akin to a motorway petrol station. It saves the time it would take the signal to make the two-way vertical trip and also prevents the loss of power due to the resistance of the vertical interconnects. What's more, moving the repeater to the interconnect layer saves space on the silicon for more logic.,Repeaters aren't the only potential use. A 2D material could also be used to build other circuits, such as on-chip power-management systems, signal buffers, and memory selectors. One thing these circuits all have in common is that they don't require the device to drive a lot of current, so one layer of 2D material would probably be sufficient., 2D devices nor the less demanding back-end-of-line circuits will be possible without a fabrication process compatible with industry-standard 300-millimeter silicon wafers. So our team at Imec is working on just that, hoping to develop a process that will serve for all applications.,The first step is identifying the most promising 2D material and device architecture. We have therefore benchmarked a variety of 2D semiconductors and 2D FET architectures against an advanced silicon FinFET device.,Because researchers have the most experience with molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), experimental devices made using it have advanced furthest. Indeed, at the , last December, Imec unveiled an MoS2 transistor with a channel just 30 nanometers across and source and drain contacts only 13 nm long. But after examining the possibilities, we've decided that MoS2 is not the answer. Instead, we concluded that among all the materials compatible with 300-mm silicon-wafer technology, tungsten disulfide (WS,) in the form of a stacked nanosheet device has the highest performance potential, meaning it can drive the most current. For less demanding, back-end-of-line applications, we also concluded that a FET architecture with a gate both below and above the semiconductor channel region works better than one with only a single gate.,We already knew one important thing about WS, before we reached that conclusion: We can make a high-quality version of it on a 300-mm silicon wafer. , for the first time in 2018 by growing the material on a wafer using metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD), a common process that grows crystals on a surface by means of a chemical reaction. The approach we took results in thickness control down to a single-molecule layer, or monolayer, over the full 300-mm wafer. The benefits of the MOCVD growth come, however, at the price of a high temperature—and recall that high temperatures are forbidden in back-end processes because they could damage the silicon devices below.,To get around this problem, we grow the WS, on a separate wafer and then transfer it to the already partially fabricated silicon wafer. The Imec team developed a unique transfer process that allows a single layer of WS,—as thin as 0.7 nm—to be moved to a silicon target wafer with negligible degradation in the 2D material's electrical properties.,The process starts by growing the WS, on an oxide-covered silicon wafer. That's then placed in contact with a specially prepared wafer. This wafer has a layer of material that melts away when illuminated by a laser. It also has a coating of adhesive. The adhesive side is pressed to the WS,-covered wafer, and the 2D material peels away from the growth wafer and sticks to the adhesive. Then the adhesive wafer with its 2D cargo is flipped over onto the target silicon wafer, which in a real chipmaking effort would already have transistors and several layers of interconnect on it. Next, a laser is shone through the wafer to break the bulk of it away, leaving only the adhesive and the WS, atop the target wafer. The adhesive is removed with chemicals and plasma. What's left is just the processed silicon with the WS, attached to it, held in place by Van der Waals forces.,The process is complicated, but it works. There is, of course, room for improvement, most importantly in mitigating defects caused by unwanted particles on the wafer surface and in eliminating some defects that occur at the edges., has been deposited, building devices can begin. On that front there have been triumphs, but some major challenges remain.,Perhaps the most crucial issue to tackle is the creation of defects in the WS,. Imperfections profoundly degrade the performance of a 2D device. In ordinary silicon devices, charge can get caught in imperfections at the interface between the gate dielectric and the channel region. These can scatter electrons or holes near the interface as they try to move through the device, slowing things down. With 2D semiconductors the scattering problem is more pronounced because the interface , the channel.,
,
,
,
,Sulfur vacancies are the most common defects that affect device channel regions. Imec is investigating how different plasma treatments might make those vacancies less chemically reactive and therefore less prone to alter the transistor's behavior. We also need to prevent more defects from forming after we've grown the monolayer. WS, and other 2D materials are known to age quickly and degrade further if already defective. Oxygen attacking a sulfur vacancy can cause more vacancies nearby, making the defect area grow larger and larger. But we've found that storing the samples in an inert environment makes a difference in preventing that spread.,Defects in the semiconductor aren't the only problems we've encountered trying to make 2D devices. Depositing insulating materials on top of the 2D surface to form the gate dielectric is a true challenge. WS, and similar materials lack dangling bonds that would otherwise help fasten the dielectric to the surface.,Our team is currently exploring two routes that might help: One is atomic layer deposition (ALD) at a reduced growth temperature. In ALD, a gaseous molecule adsorbs to the semiconductor's exposed surface to form a single layer. Then a second gas is added, reacting with the adsorbed first one to leave an atomically precise layer of material, such as the dielectric hafnium dioxide. Doing this at a reduced temperature increases the ability of the gas molecules to stick to the surface of the WS, even when no chemical bonds are available.,The other option is to enhance ALD by using a very thin oxidized layer, such as silicon oxide, to help nucleate the growth of the ALD layer. A very thin layer of silicon is deposited by a physical deposition method such as sputtering or evaporation; it's then oxidized before a regular ALD deposition of gate oxide is done. We've achieved particularly good results with evaporation.,A further challenge in making superior 2D devices is in choosing the right metals to use as source and drain contacts. Metals can alter the characteristics of the device, depending on their work function. That parameter, the minimum energy needed to extract an electron from the metal, can mean the difference between a contact that can easily inject electrons and one that can inject holes. So the Imec team has screened a variety of metals to put in contact with the WS, nanosheet. We found that the highest on-current in an ,-type device was obtained using a magnesium contact, but other metals such as nickel or tungsten work well. We'll be searching for a different metal for future ,-type devices.,Despite these challenges, we've been able to estimate the upper limits of device performance, and we've mapped out what roads to follow to get there.,As a benchmark, the Imec team used dual-gated devices like those we described earlier. We built them with small, naturally exfoliated flakes of WS,, which have fewer defects than wafer-scale semiconductors. For these lab-scale devices, we were able to measure electron mobility values up to a few hundred square centimeters per volt-second, which nearly matches crystalline silicon and is close to the theoretically predicted maximum for the 2D material. Because this excellent mobility can be found in natural material, we are confident that it should also be possible to get there with materials synthesized on 300-mm wafers, which currently reach just a few square centimeters per volt-second., main challenges ahead in 2D semiconductor development, our team has a clear view of the solutions. We know, for example, how to grow and transfer the material onto a 300-mm target wafer; we've got an idea of how to integrate the crucial gate dielectric; and we're on a path to boost the mobility of charge carriers in devices toward a level that could compare with silicon.,But, as we've laid out, there are still significant problems remaining. These will require an intensive engineering effort and an even better fundamental understanding of this new class of intriguing 2D materials. Solving these challenges will enable high-performance devices that are scaled down to atomic layers, but they might first bring new capabilities that need less demanding specifications even as we continue to scale down silicon.,

,Interior rendering of General Fusion's Fusion Demonstration Plant.,It might be time to retire that overused joke about nuclear fusion always being 30 years away. Burnaby, British Columbia-based , plans to build a large-scale demonstration reactor at the UK's , campus in Culham near Oxford.,The plant, 70 percent the size of a commercial reactor, should be operational by 2025. It will not generate power. The goal is to ""demonstrate for the first time at power-plant relevant scale that fusion can be achieved,"" says Jay Brister, chief business development officer at General Fusion. ""We're looking at the early 2030s for the first commercial plant to be operational."",They are one of 30 or so , with hats in the ring. A handful of these have caught the eyes of high-tech billionaires. Bill Gates, for instance is backing MIT spin-off ,, while General Fusion has Jeff Bezos' support.,That influx of private investment, now approaching $2 billion, is one reason fusion has moved from a distant glimmer of clean, limitless energy to a real possibility, says ,, associate director for fusion and fission energy and science at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and a co-author of a recent , outlining a vision and rough timeline for building a multibillon-dollar prototype fusion power plant in the U.S. ,Other reasons include advances in modeling and simulation, high-speed computing, materials science, and a deeper understanding of plasma physics from experiments around the world. ""It's a confluence of events that has propelled fusion into the spotlight,"" she says. ,Most fusion research since the 1960s has focused on tokamaks, doughnut-shaped reactors that use powerful electromagnetic fields confine and heat plasma. But, says McCarthy, ""there might be better ways to do fusion when it comes to a pilot plant, even though each approach has challenges."",General Fusion believes its approach, called magnetized target fusion, is the most practical for making the big leap from the physics of plasma generation and confinement to actually using the energy produced for electricity.,Their fusion vessel is lined on the inside with a liquid metal kept in place by a spinning rotor. Plasma fuel is injected into the vessel, and high-speed digital controls move pistons surrounding the reactor at different rates to drive shock waves towards the center of the vessel. This compresses the plasma and forces a fusion reaction. A magnetic field confines the plasma during this compression cycle, and for this the company uses inexpensive, room-temperature copper electromagnets instead of large superconducting magnets that require cryogenic cooling.,
,
,The compression system operates once per second, so fusion conditions occur briefly for the reactor to produce repeated bursts of energy. This energy is released as neutrons that go out and heat up the liquid metal, and that heat is used to produce steam to spin a turbine and generate electricity.,The liquid metal blanket is key for making the technology practical, Brister says. In a conventional tokamak, zippy neutrons need to be slowed down to keep them from hitting the reactor wall and damaging the machine itself. ""For us the liquid metal acts as shield,"" he says. ,Having done over 200,000 experiments on the one-tenth scale system in the laboratory, he says the company has validated all the individual components that will be put together in the demonstration reactor. In addition to showcasing plasma confinement, the demo should help the company understand the economic feasibility of a full-scale plant. Brister says the company is now doing a global search for the location of the full-scale commercial plant.,McCarthy hopes that location for that facility, which will mark a big step for practical fusion power, will be Oak Ridge. Unforeseen challenges could, of course, hinder the demonstration plant. ""Things don't always work out the way you think they will with fusion,"" she says. ""Often it's not the rocket science that gets you, it's the practical side."" ,Still, the flurry of private sector activity in the area is exciting and holds promise for nuclear fusion's place in a clean energy future. ""I'm very glad these companies are going ahead,"" she says. ""It kind of lights the fire under all of us."",For networks that need to be cheap and low power, consider outer space,

,For many people, the phrase ""Internet of Things"" probably brings to mind either smart city efforts such as , and air-quality sensors, or connected devices in their own homes. And a very natural question is, why would you ever want to use , to connect any of those devices? The answer is—you don't. It doesn't make sense to try.,But the satellite-based IoT network industry is building steam nonetheless. Although in many ways it's like satellite broadband—itself a last resort for people who have no other connectivity options—IoT networks and satellites are, in some ways, a better match for each other. The ,, for example, recently announced that its terrestrial IoT technology, , (massive IoT), could be easily used by satellites. Start-up , has had enough success in its plan to build an IoT-specific constellation that ,.,But before we get into why there's so much interest in making satellite-based IoT work, it's worth reiterating one very important point: Don't try to make an orbital IoT connection work when you have Wi-Fi on hand.,""We even tell this to our potential customers, and sometimes we lose a couple customers"" says ,, the chief technology officer of Swarm. ""We always say, look, if you have access to Wi-Fi and cell, you should probably just use that. No question, no question."",""Whenever you have terrestrial infrastructure, use that one,"" says ,, a group manager for system design at the Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated Circuits. ""This will always be cheaper, work better, easier to control."" That said, there are two instances where both Leschka and Longmier pointed out that satellites make a perfect fit for IoT networks.,The first is perhaps more obvious: If terrestrial infrastructure is the better option wherever it exists, then satellite connections for IoT networks are well-suited to delivering service where terrestrial networks don't—or can't—exist. Consider tracking devices on cargo containers being shipped across the Pacific Ocean, for example. There's no 5G network; the only way to keep an eye on a container being shipped from China to California is via satellite. Agricultural networks and networks monitoring environmental health also fall into this category.,The second category is for instances where terrestrial coverage exists, but must cross multiple networks between points A and B. This most commonly happens with logistics like truck deliveries. A truck driver traveling between several European countries, for example, would typically need to pay for multiple carriers along the route to ensure continuous service. ""In cases like that, we actually have found that customers plead with us, please let us use your service,"" says Longmier. ""We're in cell, but it's so bad that we have to cut all of these cell phone deals, and we just don't want to deal with that logistics problem."",A lot of IoT networks fall into a category that Leschka describes as ""smart metering."" The devices on these networks are transmitting small chunks of data at regular intervals—status updates, measurements, and the like. While these devices can transmit perfectly well over cell networks or Wi-Fi, there are also a handful of wireless standards catered specifically for IoT networks. What's more, these standards, while designed with terrestrial networks in mind, translate really well to satellite-based networks.,Swarm, for instance, ,. And Fraunhofer engineers' recent demonstration that mioty (massive IoT) could be beamed to and from a LEO satellite importantly showed that that the IoT technique wouldn't even need to be tweaked for it to work. Mioty via satellite just worked out of the box, Leschka says.,These IoT technologies tend to have a few qualities in common. They're designed to be low-power, so that the batteries on IoT devices aren't sapped with every transmission. They also tend to be long-ranging, to cut down on the amount of other infrastructure required to deploy a large-scale IoT project. And they're usually fairly robust against interference, because if there are dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of devices transmitting, messages can't afford to be garbled by one another. As a trade-off, they typically don't support high data rates, which is a fair concession to make for many IoT networks' smart metering needs.,It just so happens these are all desirable qualities for satellites as well. Lower power transmissions not only don't drain on-board power sources as quickly, but alleviate the need for bigger, bulkier power systems from the beginning. The need for long-ranging signals should come as no surprise—even the satellites in the lowest of low Earth orbits are still 160 kilometers (100 miles) above the ground. And different layers of the Earth's atmosphere (and conditions like rain) can wreak havoc on a signal over that distance.,Advancements in satellites are only accelerating the possibilities opened up by putting IoT technologies into orbit. Chief among those advancements is the CubeSat revolution, which is both shrinking and standardizing satellite construction. ""We designed all the satellites when we were four people, and by the time we launched, we were about 10 people,"" says Longmier. ""And that wasn't possible five years before we started."" (Swarm was founded in 2016.), There will likely be more advancements that lower the entry barriers of satellite IoT. One possibility is optical communication. Switching over to lasers for transmitting signals would free up new and existing operators from needing to acquire costly radio spectrum. ""I think getting access to spectrum is the single most difficult part of operating a space communications business,"" says Longmier. ""Had we known how difficult it was at the beginning, we may have chosen a different business plan. I'm not sure."",For now, even going into space isn't enough to fully rise above some hurdles. But if space-based IoT networks continue to gain interest, they might also be the impetus to ultimately remove those same hurdles.,Siemens, AMD, and Microsoft Azure collaborated to develop and test best practices and usage guidelines. The results they got on a 7nm production design were dramatic.",https://spectrum.ieee.org/coming-soon-to-a-processor-near-you-atomthick-transistors,semiconductor,UK,IEEE Spectrum,Coming Soon to a Processor Near You: Atom-Thick Transistors - IEEE Spectrum

Every one of these must-have consumer trinkets is a computer in disguise, with innards made from microprocessors, memory chips and circuit boards.,Your browser does not support the <audio> element.,Enjoy more audio and podcasts on, , ,or, ,.,Yet the industry upon which all this is built has been having a torrid time of late. Future Horizons, a chip-industry analysis firm, reckons that global semiconductor sales shrank by about 12% in 2019, to $410bn. Samsung Electronics, a South Korean company that is the world’s biggest maker of memory chips, reported a 56% fall in quarterly operating profits in October, dragged down by the poor performance of its chip division. Entire economies have been feeling the pain. Semiconductors account for a fifth of South Korea’s exports, which have fallen for 12 months in a row, partly owing to the sector’s weakness.,Now the slump seems to be ending. On January 8th Samsung predicted another fall in quarterly profits. But it was smaller than expected. The firm’s share price rose. The price of memory chips is up. Shares in , hynix, another South Korean chipmaker, have gained around 20% in the past month. Those of Micron, an American company, have done even better. Memory makes up about a third of semiconductor sales, and industry-watchers see it as a bellwether for the industry.,The nascent recovery reflects the nature of the chip business, where feast routinely follows famine. Despite its high-tech character, says Malcolm Penn, Future Horizons’s founder, the market for microchips is as cyclical as that for pork, soyabeans or other commodities (see chart). When times are good, chipmakers boost capacity, adding high-tech factories that are expensive to build but cheap to run. That helps supply catch up with demand. To recoup costs, chipmakers carry on producing regardless. Prices sag. When demand eventually catches up with the extra capacity, the cycle begins anew. Memory chips, which are interchangeable by design, are particularly prone to this periodicity.,The patterns are amplified or suppressed by what happens in the rest of the economy. The most recent bust, which began in 2018, was particularly deep, says Len Jenilek, a semiconductor analyst at , Markit. The memory market consists of two main types of memory, known as , and flash. Their cycles do not always synchronise, but last year they did. The car industry, which has become a big consumer of chips, had its worst year in a decade. Other big buyers, particularly large data-centre operators like Google, Microsoft and Alibaba, cut back on purchases. The start of a tech-flavoured trade war between America and China did not help.,Whether the rebound will be correspondingly strong likewise depends on broader trends. Economic growth in China, a big importer of chips, is cooling. The bull run in America’s stockmarket is now the longest in history, spurring talk of a correction. American officials are working on a new round of trade restrictions that could rattle the industry.,But for those with strong nerves, chips look like a good long-term bet. Underlying the booms and busts is a growth in demand that, according to Mr Penn, has averaged 8% or so a year for 40 years. The industry’s products have become millions of times more powerful in that period, while the world has grown hungrier for computing power. Mr Jenilek cites 5, phone networks and chips customised for , as two big new sources of demand. This week Las Vegas brimmed with both. ,This article appeared in the Business section of the print edition under the headline ""Memory loss and gain"",A daily email with the best of our journalism,Published since September 1843 to take part in, , ,Copyright © The Economist Newspaper Limited ,2021,.

22 Jan 2020,"4:39 PM on Jan 22, 2020 CST,Dallas-based Texas Instruments will close two North Texas semiconductor plants over the next three to five years, the company said Wednesday in an earnings call.,The semiconductor maker plans to gradually shut down the manufacturing facilities in Dallas and Sherman. It said the closures will be completed between 2023 and 2025.,Each facility has about 500 employees, according to the company. The factories will continue to operate and there is no immediate change to staffing.,Texas Instruments said it plans to transfer many of the workers to other Dallas-area manufacturing sites. Those who do not get new roles will receive severance packages and transition assistance, the company said.,The plant closings reflect a change in the way TI makes chips for a wide range of devices, from smartphones and connected cars to industrial machinery.,The Dallas and Sherman factories are more than 50 years old. They are the only two remaining facilities with 150-millimeter wafer production. The company has shifted toward making larger, 300-millimeter wafers that are cut into numerous analog chips. The larger wafers are more cost-effective because they yield more chips.,In a statement, the company said the Dallas and Sherman factories ""have been instrumental to TI’s success for the last five decades; however, they do not have the scale, infrastructure and efficiency needed to be upgraded to 300-millimeter technology and carry us competitively into the future.”,Texas Instruments is building a , on one of its existing sites in Richardson. The shell of the building is expected to be completed in late 2021, but the company has not yet announced an opening date.,Dave Pahl, who leads investor relations, said in Wednesday’s earnings call that timing for installing tools and hiring staff at the Richardson plant will depend on market demand. He said about $1.5 billion of revenue comes from the two factories that are closing, but said that business will shift to 300-millimeter plants.,Texas Instruments has 14 manufacturing sites around the world, including some with multiple factories. In the U.S., it has plants in North Texas and Maine.,On Wednesday, Texas Instruments topped Wall Street expectations and indicated electronics makers’ purchases are on the rebound after U.S.-China trade uncertainty. The company reported fourth-quarter profit of $1.07 billion, or $1.12 a share. The average estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was for earnings of $1.02 a share.,The chipmaker posted revenue of $3.35 billion in the three-month period, which also beat forecasts. Nine analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $3.22 billion.,For the year, the company reported profit of $5.02 billion, or $5.24 a share. Its revenue totaled $14.38 billion.,For the current quarter ending in April, Texas Instruments said it expects revenue in the range of $3.12 billion to $3.38 billion. Analysts surveyed by Zacks had expected revenue of $3.2 billion.,Texas Instruments shares have risen roughly 4% since the beginning of the year, while the Standard & Poor’s 500 index has climbed nearly 3%. Shares closed Wednesday at $133.34, a rise of 38% in the last 12 months.,, Staff Writer,. Melissa covers technology, innovation and other business news for The Dallas Morning News.

15 Jan 2020,"TAIPEI -- Washington has upped the pressure on , to produce its military-use chips in the U.S., in order to ensure that the world's biggest contract chipmaker can manufacture the high-security components free from potential Chinese interference, sources have told the Nikkei Asian Review.,TSMC, which makes computer chips used in American F-35 fighter jets and serves as a key supplier to Apple as well as Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei Technologies, has sidestepped , before.,But as Beijing and Washington jostle for technological and military supremacy, the company faces growing American pressure to make a firm decision about producing in the U.S. or offering another security-compatible solution before the U.S. presidential election in November.,Though Washington and Beijing are due to sign the first phase of a trade deal this week, easing two years of bilateral tensions, the pressure on TSMC shows that global tech supply chains are still decoupling as security hawks in the U.S. administration continue to press the White House to act over China's technological and military buildup.,""The U.S. government wants chips that go into military projects to be built on American soil,"" a senior Taiwanese government official, who was briefed about Washington's approaches to TSMC given the company's strategic and technological importance, told Nikkei. ""That's for national security concerns, and they [the U.S.] don't plan to back off on that."",TSMC, which holds a 50% share of the world's chip foundry business, supplies computer chips to Huawei and American tech giants such as Google, Qualcomm and Intel. The Taiwanese company also supplies high-performance chips for U.S. military suppliers such as Xilinx, which in turn makes components for American F-35 fighter jets and satellites.,Washington has made keeping Chinese technology and surveillance at bay a global priority. TSMC, as a major U.S. and Chinese chip supplier, has often found itself in the middle of the technology standoff as a result. In addition to the F-35 jets, TSMC makes U.S. Defense Department-approved ""military grade"" chips that may be used by some of its other American clients for classified military purposes.,Industry sources said American officials talked with TSMC ""several times"" ahead of last weekend's election in Taiwan, which saw China-skeptic President Tsai Ing-wen reelected in an outcome that Beijing decried but that U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo hailed as ""a force for good in the world."",Ian Steff, assistant secretary of the U.S. Commerce Department, last month made his third visit to Taiwan during 2019, where he met with TSMC founder Morris Chang and Chairman Mark Liu at a private reception, one executive source told Nikkei.,""We've noticed that many U.S. tech executives and government officials are concerned about their country's dependence on TSMC and the security of their defense industry's supply chains,"" said Su Tze-yun, director of Taiwan's Institute for National Defense and Security Research.,""That's why the U.S. constantly hopes that TSMC could stand with them to make chips somewhere else other than just Taiwan, which they think is not completely safe because China has not ruled out the possibility of taking control of the island by force,"" the director said.,Su was referring to Chinese President Xi Jinping, who repeated last year that Beijing would not rule out using force to expedite unification between mainland China and Taiwan, which it views as a wayward province.,Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang reiterated Beijing's stance this week, saying that he hoped the international community would continue to ""support the just cause of Chinese people to oppose the secessionist activities for 'Taiwan independence' and realize national reunification."",The Pentagon has long worried about such risks and last year contacted several TSMC customers, warning them about the security implications of offshoring production to a Taiwanese company. TSMC's work for Huawei may add an extra perceived level of risk.,Industry sources said they expect the U.S. administration to increase restrictions this year on the use of U.S. technology by Huawei, which Washington views as a security threat. Huawei has consistently denied the allegations.,Huawei, which last year asked TSMC to transfer more chip production to its $3 billion advanced plant in Nanjing that started production in 2018, accounts for 10% of TSMC's revenue. Chinese clients in total provide around 20%.,Some China hawks in President Donald Trump's administration, which this week urged the U.K. to exclude Huawei from Britain's 5G network, may even be seeking a near-outright ban on all U.S. technology sales to China, though no consensus exists on the issue in the White House, The Wall Street Journal , on Wednesday.  ,""Before the next U.S. presidential election, TSMC will have to respond further to this urgent request from its U.S. customers under pressure from the American government to make sure that sensitive chips will either be more secure or, better, that such chips are produced on American soil,"" another source familiar with TSMC's situation said.,TSMC said repeatedly last year that it would not rule out building or buying a high-specification plant in the U.S. to assuage such concerns, though the company also cautioned that such a move would need to be weighed carefully given the higher operating costs involved.,""We have never ruled out building or acquiring a fab [semiconductor fabrication plant] in the United States, but currently there is no concrete plan,"" TSMC reiterated when Nikkei sought comment for this article.,TSMC's closest American rival, contract chipmaker Globalfoundries, has one advanced chip facility in New York. But the company, owned by the Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund, is considered unable to meet U.S. demands for the latest chip technologies needed in advanced applications, such as military uses.,That has left TSMC to walk a delicate line between its ,, especially given security concerns about the risk of computer chips being compromised in a conflict via so-called back doors that might cause entire networks to be shut down.,""A lot of work lies ahead to effectively adopt a holistic, ""zero-trust"" approach to security in microelectronics,"" Lisa Porter, the U.S. deputy undersecretary of defense for research and engineering, wrote last September in a Defense Department article about electronic security.,The U.S. accounts for 60% of TSMC's sales, but the company operates only its subsidiary WaferTech there, producing chips for mature technologies. The majority of TSMC's production is in Taiwan. ,""As the world becomes more chaotic, TSMC is emerging as a strategic territory that all geopolitical forces aim to secure,"" Chang, the company founder, told reporters and employees in November.,Sign up to our newsletters to get our best stories delivered straight to your inbox.,Discover the all new ,Nikkei Asia app,Discover the all new ,Nikkei Asia app,Stay ahead with our ,;, the most dynamic market in the world.,Stay ahead with ,Get , within Asia itself.,Get , within Asia itself.,

24 Jan 2020,"University of California, Berkeley, scientists have created a blue light-emitting diode (LED) from a trendy new semiconductor material, halide perovskite, overcoming a major barrier to employing these cheap, easy-to-make materials in electronic devices.,In the process, however, the researchers discovered a fundamental property of halide perovskites that may prove a barrier to their widespread use as solar cells and transistors.,Alternatively, this unique property may open up a whole new world for perovskites far beyond that of today's standard semiconductors.,In a paper appearing Jan. 24 in the journal ,, UC Berkeley chemist Peidong Yang and his colleagues show that the crystal structure of the halide perovskites changes with temperature, humidity and the chemical environment, disrupting their optical and electronic properties. Without close control of the physical and chemical environment, perovskite devices are inherently unstable. This is not a major problem for traditional semiconductors.,""Some people may say this is a limitation. For me, this is a great opportunity,"" said Yang, the S. K. and Angela Chan Distinguished Chair in Energy in the College of Chemistry and director of the Kavli Energy NanoSciences Institute. ""This is new physics: a new class of semiconductors that can be readily reconfigured, depending on what sort of environment you put them in. They could be a really good sensor, maybe a really good photoconductor, because they will be very sensitive in their response to light and chemicals."",Current semiconductors made of silicon or gallium nitride are very stable over a range of temperatures, primarily because their crystal structures are held together by strong covalent bonds. Halide perovskite crystals are held together by weaker ionic bonds, like those in a salt crystal. This means they're easier to make -- they can be evaporated out of a simple solution -- but also susceptible to humidity, heat and other environmental conditions.,""This paper is not just about showing off that we made this blue LED,"" said Yang, who is a senior faculty scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) and a UC Berkeley professor of materials science and engineering. ""We are also telling people that we really need to pay attention to the structural evolution of perovskites during the device operation, any time you drive these perovskites with an electrical current, whether it is an LED, a solar cell or a transistor. This is an intrinsic property of this new class of semiconductor and affects any potential optoelectronic device in the future using this class of material."",Making semiconductor diodes that emit blue light has always been a challenge, Yang said. The 2014 Nobel Prize for Physics was awarded for the breakthrough creation of efficient blue light-emitting diodes from gallium nitride. Diodes, which emit light when an electric current flows through them, are optoelectronic components in fiber optic circuits as well as general purpose LED lights.,Since halide perovskites first drew wide attention in 2009, when Japanese scientists discovered that they make highly efficient solar cells, these easily made, inexpensive crystals have excited researchers. So far, red- and green-emitting diodes have been demonstrated, but not blue. Halide perovskite blue-emitting diodes have been unstable -- that is, their color shifts to longer, redder wavelengths with use.,As Yang and his colleagues discovered, this is due to the unique nature of perovskites' crystal structure. Halide perovskites are composed of a metal, such as lead or tin, equal numbers of larger atoms, such as cesium, and three times the number of halide atoms, such as chlorine, bromine or iodine.,When these elements are mixed together in solution and then dried, the atoms assemble into a crystal, just as salt crystalizes from sea water. Using a new technique and the ingredients cesium, lead and bromine, the UC Berkeley and Berkeley Lab chemists created perovskite crystals that emit blue light and then bombarded them with X-rays at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) to determine their crystalline structure at various temperatures. They found that, when heated from room temperature (about 300 Kelvin) to around 450 Kelvin, a common operating temperature for semiconductors, the crystal's squashed structure expanded and eventually sprang into a new orthorhombic or tetragonal configuration.,Since the light emitted by these crystals depends on the arrangement of and distances between atoms, the color changed with temperature, as well. A perovskite crystal that emitted blue light (450 nanometers wavelength) at 300 Kelvin suddenly emitted blue-green light at 450 Kelvin.,Yang attributes perovskites' flexible crystal structure to the weaker ionic bonds typical of halide atoms. Naturally occurring mineral perovskite incorporates oxygen instead of halides, producing a very stable mineral. Silicon-based and gallium nitride semiconductors are similarly stable because the atoms are linked by strong covalent bonds.,According to Yang, blue-emitting perovskite diodes have been hard to create because the standard technique of growing the crystals as a thin film encourages formation of mixed crystal structures, each of which emits at a different wavelength. Electrons get funneled down to those crystals with the smallest bandgap -- that is, the smallest range of unallowed energies -- before emitting light, which tends to be red.,To avoid this, Yang's postdoctoral fellows and co-first authors -- Hong Chen, Jia Lin and Joohoon Kang -- grew single, layered crystals of perovskite and, adapting a low-tech method for creating graphene, used tape to peel off a single layer of uniform perovskite. When incorporated into a circuit and zapped with electricity, the perovskite glowed blue. The actual blue wavelength varied with the number of layers of octahedral perovskite crystals, which are separated from one another by a layer of organic molecules that allows easy separation of perovskite layers and also protects the surface.,Nevertheless, the SLAC experiments showed that the blue-emitting perovskites changed their emission colors with temperature. This property can have interesting applications, Yang said. Two years ago, he demonstrated a window made of halide perovskite that becomes dark in the sun and transparent when the sun goes down and also produces photovoltaic energy.,""We need to think in different ways of using this class of semiconductor,"" he said. ""We should not put halide perovskites into the same application environment as a traditional covalent semiconductor, like silicon. We need to realize that this class of material has intrinsic structural properties that make it ready to reconfigure. We should utilize that."",The work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy's Basic Energy Sciences program.

The leading neutron detection technologies currently used involve He-gas-filled proportional counters and light scintillators for thermalized neutrons.,Semiconductors have the potential to offer the next generation of neutron detectors that could compete with or superior to existing detectors.,Mercouri Kanatzidis from Northwestern University ,, ,Now, scientists from , and Argonne National Laboratory have developed a new material that opens doors for a new class of neutron detectors. They have developed a semiconductor-based detector that can absorb neutrons and generate electrical signals that can be easily measured. Their detector is highly efficient and stable and can be used both in small, portable devices for field inspections and massive detectors that use arrays of crystals.,Excellent at absorbing neutrons, lithium quickly emerged as the most promising material for neutron detecting devices. But integrating lithium into a semiconductor and making it stable (lithium crumbles when it meets water) was another story.,For the study, scientists discovered the right combination of materials and created a functional device that also keeps lithium stable. Their new material—lithium-indium-phosphorous-selenium—is layered in structure and enriched with the lithium-6 isotope.,Kanatzidis said, ,The subsequent semiconductor neutron detector can detect thermal neutrons from even a fragile source within nanoseconds. It additionally can distinguish among neutrons and different kinds of nuclear signals, for example, gamma rays. This prevents false alarms.,Furthermore, as it contains a very high amount of lithium, thus a smaller fraction of the material can absorb the same amount of neutrons as a giant device.

20 Jan 2020,"Advertisement,Supported by,Micron secured some gains from the China deal but it may end up suffering bigger losses from the broader U.S.-China battle., and ,WASHINGTON — Among the corporate titans recognized last week by President Trump during a White House signing ceremony for his China trade deal was Sanjay Mehrotra, the chief executive of Micron Technology, whose Idaho semiconductor company is at the heart of Mr. Trump’s trade war.,Micron, which makes memory chips for computers and smartphones, is precisely the kind of advanced technology company that the Trump administration views as crucial to maintaining a competitive edge over China. After Micron rebuffed ,, it watched with disbelief as its innovations were , and its business was blocked from China.,China’s treatment of American companies like Micron fed Mr. Trump’s decision to unleash a punishing trade war with the world’s second-largest economy, a fight he said would halt Beijing’s use of unfair practices to undermine the United States. But that two-year conflagration may wind up being more damaging to American technology companies.,The initial trade deal announced last week should make operating in China easier for companies like Micron. The deal contains provisions meant to protect American technology and trade secrets and allow companies to challenge China on accusations of theft, including older cases like Micron’s that precede the agreement.,But Mr. Trump’s aggressive trade approach has also accelerated a technology arms race between the two countries, putting American companies like Micron at risk as the two nations try to ,. In an effort to reduce its reliance on American components, China has expedited efforts to produce its own semiconductors, driverless cars, artificial intelligence and other technologies. Those efforts, along with the Trump administration’s , to China, could hurt the very companies Mr. Trump set out to protect.,“Let’s be clear, the trade war has been very bad for the semiconductor industry in several ways,” said Robert D. Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a think tank funded by the tech industry. “It’s like China woke up and said, ‘We’ve relied too much on the United States.’”,The trade deal does nothing to curtail China’s use of subsidies, industrial plans and state-owned companies, which have helped it build formidable industries in steel, wind turbines and solar panels. Those state-directed efforts, which put many American manufacturers out of business, are now being harnessed for high-tech industries.,The Trump administration is constructing its own walls around American technology, reducing access to the lucrative Chinese market out of security concerns. It is restricting exports of sensitive technologies, , and , in the United States.,The administration is considering further restricting sales to Huawei, the Chinese telecom company that relies on components from Micron and other American suppliers. And the China trade deal , in Chinese goods in place as Mr. Trump tries to push American companies to bring manufacturing back home.,Semiconductor sales to China, which represent more than half the global chip demand, have fallen, and semiconductor stocks have been ,.,Mr. Trump and his supporters say that conflict is no longer avoidable, and that the president’s unconventional approach is necessary to take on a growing threat from China. Officials across the administration look with suspicion on Chinese industrial plans, including Made in China 2025, which , for 10 advanced industries, including semiconductors.,American officials worry that gaining an advantage in semiconductors would give China both a commercial and military edge.,Chips, which serve as the tiny sensors, brains and memories of all high-tech devices, are crucial to next-generation telecom networks, supercomputers, artificial intelligence and driverless cars, as well as military ships, satellites and aircraft. They are also one of the United States’ largest exports, along with airplanes, oil and cars.,While China’s ability to make chips is still far behind the United States’, the Chinese government, its state-owned enterprises, and provincial and private equity funds have been pumping billions of dollars into the industry, particularly the kind of memory chips that Micron makes. In areas where Chinese companies cannot develop or buy technology, companies say, some will simply steal their intellectual property.,For the Trump administration, which was looking for a fight with China, Micron’s story proved a formative one. As officials prepared an , into Chinese intellectual property theft that would ultimately spiral into the trade war, Micron provided a “camera ready” case that fit everything the administration was looking for, one industry executive said.,In 2015, Micron was the target of , by a Chinese state-owned company, but the overture was withdrawn over United States national security concerns. In 2016, another Chinese state-owned company, Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit,, with a Taiwanese company to steal the American company’s designs and market them as their own.,According to Taiwanese authorities, Fujian Jinhua used Micron’s proprietary designs to build an enormous $5.7 billion microchip factory in China. In 2018, the Department of Justice , with stealing trade secrets from Micron, and the Commerce Department , for national security concerns.,The same year, a Chinese court , Micron from selling some products in China, after Fujian Jinhua and another company accused Micron of patent infringement.,Through 2017 and 2018, Micron employees met repeatedly with administration officials, sometimes with the National Security Council and National Economic Council. The company’s case was discussed in internal planning meetings attended by Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, and Peter Navarro, a top Trump trade adviser.,In July of last year, Mr. Trump met at the White House with Mr. Mehrotra of Micron, as well as the chiefs of Intel, Google and Broadcom, to discuss the trade clash with China and the administration’s policies toward Huawei.,Two months later, in an address to the United Nations, Mr. Trump described the Micron theft as a rationale for the trade war.,“To advance the Chinese government’s five-year economic plan, a company owned by the Chinese state allegedly stole Micron’s designs, valued at up to $8.7 billion,” the president said. “Soon, the Chinese company obtains patents for nearly an identical product, and Micron was banned from selling its own goods in China. But we are seeking justice.”,“For years, these abuses were tolerated, ignored or even encouraged,” Mr. Trump added. “But as far as America is concerned, those days are over.”,Chip makers initially supported the Trump administration’s willingness to take on China. Companies had long grumbled about intellectual property theft and unfair treatment in the Chinese market, but they had little recourse: Going public about their troubles could spook investors and invite Chinese retaliation.,Then, in April 2018, the administration , that would directly hit semiconductor companies by raising prices for imported equipment and materials. A chip finished in China would be subject to a 25 percent tariff, even if its components had been made in America.,The tariffs caught the industry by surprise. The Semiconductor Industry Association, a trade group, pushed back, , that the tariffs would “undermine U.S. technological leadership, cost jobs, and adversely impact U.S. consumers of semiconductor products and the U.S. semiconductor producers.”,Some industry executives grew more nervous as Mr. Trump escalated his trade fight and the prospect of an economic rupture between the United States and China became more real. Chinese customers shifted their purchases to suppliers in South Korea, Taiwan and elsewhere.,Mr. Trump’s trade pact did ink some victories — it includes greater protections for companies like Micron, including preliminary injunctions and expanded legal recourse for theft of trade secrets. It also contains new promises from China to refrain from pressuring American businesses to transfer their technology to Chinese companies, and it allows American companies to sue individuals, including former employees and hackers.,Semiconductor companies said they would press the administration to make more gains in the next phase of negotiations, including subsidies, which Mr. Trump said he plans to address. Just getting China to acknowledge and agree to forgo unfair practices was progress, they said.,In a statement, Micron said it applauded the deal. “We look forward to additional discussions between the countries on significant issues that are important to Micron and the semiconductor industry, such as intellectual property protection and subsidies,” said Jon Hoganson, Micron’s managing director of global government affairs.,But the fight has spilled over into more damaging areas. Last May, the Commerce Department placed Huawei, which makes handsets and telecom equipment, , that bans it from buying some American products. Other Chinese technology companies ,, and the government began planning which types of advanced technologies ,.,Micron had so far experienced limited effect from Mr. Trump’s tariffs since it does not ship the products it makes in China to the United States. But Huawei’s blacklisting was potentially devastating — 13 percent of Micron’s chip sales are to the Chinese company.,In its fourth-quarter earnings call with investors last September, Micron warned that the clash could damage its bottom line.,“We see ongoing uncertainty surrounding U.S.-China trade negotiations. If the Entity List restrictions against Huawei continue and we are unable to get licenses, we could see a worsening decline in our sales to Huawei over the coming quarters,” Mr. Mehrotra said. Micron’s stock sank 11 percent after his remarks.,Micron, Intel and other companies with global operations initially , to Huawei since the rule did not restrict products containing less than 25 percent of certain types of American content. But the Commerce Department is considering lowering that threshold and expanding the number of goods subject to the ban, according to five people with knowledge of the plan.,Like other Chinese companies, Huawei has worked to curtail its dependence on America. By substituting parts from Japan and other countries, the company has recently produced handsets and telecom equipment that do not contain any American components.,Its internal semiconductor unit, HiSilicon, has also developed replacements for advanced chips that Huawei once bought from American companies.

23 Jan 2020,"Meeting critical challenges like transistor performance, interconnect resistance and capacitance, and reliability will require more than just EUV.,The recent IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting (IEDM) reaffirmed that the semiconductor industry is in a period of reinvention as we grapple with the challenges and opportunities promised by the Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data and AI.,That such change is underway was made evident by a panel I was honored to moderate titled, “The Future of Logic: EUV is Here, Now What?” Joining me were distinguished thought leaders from several of the world’s top technology companies:,While each panelist brought their own perspective to bear, there was consensus that applications enabled by AI and Big Data are already causing the electronics industry to forge new and divergent paths. The advent of EUV helps from a device scaling perspective, but it fails to address critical challenges that remain in other areas such as transistor performance, interconnect resistance and capacitance, and reliability. Solving those challenges requires multiple techniques that extend beyond scaling to include the use of new materials, new types of embedded nonvolatile memories and advanced logic architectures, new approaches to deposition and etch, and innovations in packaging and chiplet design. In other words, we need a New Playbook for semiconductor design and manufacturing supported by a collaborative design process that favors heterogeneous integration and system optimization.,What will this dawning era mean for our industry? Consider that for the past 10-plus years, the economics of the semiconductor industry have been defined largely by the manufacturing requirements of smartphones. That dynamic is shifting as AI introduces a new set of needs driven by an insatiable appetite for data. In fact, 2018 was the first year that machines generated more data than humans, with much of that data migrating from the edge to the cloud.,That’s what was so compelling about the IEDM panel, which drew insights from across the industry design chain—from TSMC and Intel to Facebook. What we confirmed in sharing our views is that the semiconductor design and manufacturing model is evolving and will look extremely different in the years to come. Take the design requirements of augmented reality glasses as an example. While they need some kind of logic element, they also require advanced optics and display technology, embedded nonvolatile memory, audio specialization, and a host of AI-enabled algorithms for computer vision, gesture and facial recognition and other information that must be sensed, stored and locally processed—all in a very small form factor with extremely low power consumption.,This bifurcation in the product space is introducing new and different material challenges and puts the industry at a tipping point by placing a premium on co-design, from materials and process technology to algorithms and systems. Or, as we like to say, “from materials to systems.” After hearing the perspectives of our panelists, it’s now clearer than ever: it will take a village to enable the chips that meet the new demands of the AI Era., ,(Note: This name will be displayed publicly),(This will not be displayed publicly) , ,

                  ,Credit: FBH/schurian.com,FBH exhibits novel diode lasers and modules at Photonics West 2020. Applications include materials processing, LiDAR, medicine, and (Raman) spectroscopy. Progress in UV LEDs is presented jointly with the spin-off UVphotonics. ,The Ferdinand-Braun-Institut (FBH) presents its developments and advancements in diode lasers and UV light-emitting diodes (LEDs) at Photonics West 2020, San Francisco (USA), February 4-6, 2020. At the German Pavilion, the institute showcases its full range of capabilities, from design through chips to modules and prototype systems. BeamXpert, another FBH spin-off, demonstrates its software, enabling real-time simulation of laser radiation in optical systems. The FBH is also well represented at the accompanying conferences (1-6 February) with 20 scientific contributions. In addition to its established diode-laser-based light sources, the FBH exhibits at the booth a terahertz camera sensor that operates in a broad frequency range between 500 - 2500 GHz. It offers high sensitivity of NEP ? 50 pW/Hz0.5 along with a fast response time. Therefore it is ideally suited for imaging systems used for quality control in industrial applications. It can also be integrated into medical equipment, e.g., for diabetes diagnostics and spectroscopy. ,High-power diode laser stacks for high duty cycle operation,
,In industrial laser technology continuous wave high-power diode lasers are used as pump sources for fiber and disk lasers, where they have conquered the multibillion-dollar market of cutting and welding. There are also many current and emerging applications in industry and basic research for high-energy-class pulsed lasers, which need customized pump sources. To address such high-pulse-energy applications, the FBH combines efficient large aperture (1200 μm) single emitter diode lasers into novel passively-side-cooled multi-kW class stacks, to support high duty cycle quasi-continuous-wave pump applications. Available sources include > 3 kW stacks at 940 nm for pumping Yb:YAG (1 ms 200 Hz) and in a first demonstration at Photonics West 2020 (LASE - Conference 11262, Session 1), > 1 kW stacks at 780 nm for pumping Th:YAG (10 ms 10 Hz).,
,FBH's high pulse power laser source with a 48-emitter diode laser bar is ideally suited for 3D object detection, e.g., for line scanners in automotive LiDAR. Scanning LiDARs emit rapid laser pulses which are reflected by objects. The return time of each pulse is then measured by a detector, thereby creating a point cloud of the measured surface. Unlike point scanners, which capture objects point by point via 2D steering mirrors, line scanners use a laser array. Scanning points are thus measured over a wide line covering a large area via 1D laser beam steering and detection of returning laser pulses in a detector row. The FBH laser source delivers 4-10 ns long optical pulses with >600 W pulse peak power at 905 nm wavelength. The wavelength shifts with temperature by 0.06 nm/K only. The DBR-stabilized laser emission has a width of 0.15 nm and >30 dB side mode suppression. The bar is electrically driven by a new in-house developed high-speed GaN driver providing current pulses of up to 800 A with 100 kHz repetition frequency and higher.,
,SERDS is a powerful and easy-to-use tool to extract Raman signals efficiently and rapidly from disturbing backgrounds such as fluorescence and daylight. Based on FBH's dual-wavelength Y-branch DBR-RW lasers, the institute has developed a compact turnkey system, which is a fully operational light source with integrated temperature control and five individual current sources to tailor and adjust the emission. It is programmable using a USB interface. The system offers fast alternating operation between both laser lines for SERDS to extract Raman signals efficiently from disturbing backgrounds. The spectral distance between the two SERDS wavelengths can be electrically adjusted using implemented on-chip micro-heaters. The system has been demonstrated for wavelengths around 785 nm and 671 nm and successfully utilized for measurements on food, soil, and plants. ,Visit the Ferdinand-Braun-Institut and its spin-offs at Photonics West 2020, German Pavilion, booth 4545.

10 Jan 2020,"On Semiconductor may be a lesser-known chip maker, but the stock could be an incredibly strong performer over the next year, according to analysts at Needham and Company. ,""We contend ON is significantly undervalued,"" wrote Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill. ""Few companies have a financial profile to grow margins by 500-700 basis points and double EPS over the long-term."" ,Gill thinks On Semi can reach $3 in earnings per share over the long-term.

              ,SAN JOSE, Calif. and GUANGZHOU, China, Jan.  06, 2020  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GOWIN Semiconductor Corp., the world’s fastest-growing programmable logic company, releases full production of their GW1NZ-ZV FPGA, offering 50% lower static power consumption over competing flash-based FPGAs at under 28uW.,Low power FPGAs have had a distinct advantage over many microcontrollers for applications requiring always-on and always-monitoring of IO and peripherals in a system. The reason is that microcontrollers must always have their entire processor clocked in order to provide monitoring functions. While the processor speed can be changed to consume less power its active power consumption is often considerable. Alternatively, an FPGA’s dynamic power consumption is based on the number of logic elements used and the rate at which data is being transitioned and clocked. If an FPGA’s static power is low, FPGAs can be optimized to consume dynamic power only on the small subset of logic elements used for IO and interface monitoring while the other logic elements are gated from seeing any activity.,GOWIN’s Ultra-low power flash-based GW1NZ-ZV device is now in full production offering the lowest power consumption to date. With a 0.9V core voltage, it offers static power consumption at less than 28uW. As a result, the GW1NZ-ZV FPGA is over 2.4x lower in static power consumption when compared to competitive flash-based FPGA devices. The low sub-1V core voltage also promotes significantly lower dynamic power consumption and overall total power profile.,Mobile, Edge and IoT applications benefit tremendously from FPGAs in always-on applications due to their ability to continuously monitor data at very low power consumption while the rest of the system is placed in standby. Monitoring peripheral activity with an FPGA often only requires a small portion of the total logic elements. The FPGA can dynamically throttle additional FPGA resources or be used to wake up other components in a system behaving as a power management unit for the FPGA design itself as well as the product.,About GOWIN Semiconductor Corp.,Founded in 2014, GOWIN Semiconductor Corp., headquartered with major R&D in China, has the vision to accelerate customer innovation worldwide with our programmable solutions. We focus on optimizing our products and removing barriers for customers using programmable logic devices.

,5nm isn't publically available yet, but Samsung is already making big steps in the 3nm space.,The 7nm process is reaching its peak. Nvidia's rumored to start placing orders at TSMC and Samsung for releasing its , mid-2020. Meanwhile, we already know that ,, with Apple purportedly having reserved two-thirds of TSMC's 5nm capacity for the A14 ,expected to power the iPhone 12.,Now, Samsung has succeeded  in making the first strides towards the 3nm process, as reported by the Korean , this week. According to the report, Samsung's goal is to become the world's number one semiconductor manufacturer by 2030.,Samsung's work on the 3nm process is based on the Gate All Around (GAAFET) technology rather than FinFET. This supposedly reduces the total silicon size by 35% while using about 50% less power and allows for the same amount of power consumption and 33% performance increase over the 5nm FinFET process.,We first heard that , process a year ago, when it said that it targeted mass production in 2021. That was considered ambitious at the time, but if Samsung has already succeeded in producing its first 3nm prototypes, the vendor might be closer than expected.,The GAAFET design differs from the FinFET design in that it is built around having gates around four sides of the channel, which ensures reduced power leakage and thus improved control over the channel -- a fundamental step when shrinking the process node. This switch to a more efficient transistor design paired with the decreased node size is what enables the tremendous jump in performance per watt over a 5nm FinFET process.,Get instant access to breaking news, in-depth reviews and helpful tips.,Thank you for signing up to Tom's Hardware.

05 Jan 2020,"Discover Thomson Reuters,By ,, ,, ,7 Min Read,WASHINGTON/AMSTERDAM/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The Trump administration mounted an extensive campaign to block the sale of Dutch chip manufacturing technology to China, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo lobbying the Netherlands government and White House officials sharing a classified intelligence report with the country’s Prime Minister, people familiar with the effort told Reuters.,The high-level push, which has not previously been reported, demonstrates the importance the White House places on preventing China from getting hold of a machine required to make the world’s fastest microprocessors. It also shows the challenges facing the U.S. government’s largely unilateral efforts to stem the flow of advanced technology to China.,The U.S. campaign began in 2018, after the Dutch government gave semiconductor equipment company ASML, the global leader in a critical chip-making process known as lithography, a license to sell its most advanced machine to a Chinese customer, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.,Over the following months, U.S officials examined whether they could block the sale outright and held at least four rounds of talks with Dutch officials, three sources told Reuters.,The effort culminated in the White House on July 18 when Deputy National Security Advisor Charles Kupperman raised the issue with Dutch officials during the visit of Netherlands Prime Minister Mark Rutte, who was given an intelligence report on the potential repercussions of China acquiring ASML’s technology, according to a former U.S. government official familiar with the matter.,The pressure appears to have worked. Shortly after the White House visit, the Dutch government decided not to renew ASML’s export license, and the $150 million machine has not been shipped.,Ilse van Oevering, a spokeswoman for Rutte’s office, declined comment, saying the government cannot discuss individual licensing cases.,The White House declined to comment. Kupperman did not reply to a request for comment.,The delayed shipment was first reported on Nov. 6 by the Nikkei Asian Review, but details of the U.S. pressure campaign have not previously been disclosed. ASML said it is still awaiting approval of a new license request and declined further comment.,ASML has never publicly disclosed the identity of the Chinese customer, but Nikkei and others have reported that it is Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC), China’s biggest chip-making specialist. SMIC did not reply to a request for a comment.,The ASML machine uses extreme ultraviolet (EUV) light beams, generated by lasers and focused by giant mirrors, to lay out extraordinarily narrow circuits on slabs of silicon known as wafers. That in turn makes it possible to create faster and more powerful microprocessors, memory chips and other advanced components, which are critical for consumer electronics and military applications alike.,Only a few companies, including America’s Intel Corp, South Korea’s Samsung Electronics and Taiwan’s TSMC, are currently capable of manufacturing the most sophisticated chips. But China has made catching up to those companies in chip-making technology a key national priority and is investing tens of billions of dollars in the effort.,That drive has run head-on into the Trump administration’s efforts to block the flow of sensitive technology to China on national security grounds. Companies selling U.S.-made goods are now barred from shipping them to blacklisted Chinese firms including telecoms giant Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL] and surveillance vendor Hikvision without a special license.,The U.S. government can also deny licenses to firms that want to sell goods made with U.S. technology to any Chinese company, not just those on the export blacklist. But blocking companies like ASML that manufacture overseas is much more difficult.,Under current regulations, the U.S. can require a license for many high-tech products shipped to China from other countries if U.S.-made components make up more than 25% of the value. The U.S. Department of Commerce conducted an audit of ASML’s EUV machine, two sources told Reuters, but found it did not meet the 25% threshold, according to one of the people.,The U.S. Department of Commerce is now considering lowering the 25% threshold in some cases, Reuters reported in November.,With no way to block the sale directly, the Trump administration pressed its Dutch ally to consider the security issues. Lithography equipment falls under the purview of an international agreement known as the Wassenaar Arrangement, which coordinates export restrictions of so-called ‘dual-use’ technology that has commercial and military applications.,U.S. Department of Defense officials met their Dutch counterparts several times to discuss the security risks of the sale, two sources told Reuters. Meetings took place at the Netherlands embassy in Washington in late 2018 and January 2019, two separate sources said.,Pompeo urged Rutte himself to block the sale, despite commercial pressures to let ASML proceed, during a visit to the Netherlands last June, three sources said.,With a market value of more than 110 billion euros, ASML has grown to dominate the lithography market over the last two decades and is the pride of Dutch industry.,“Our ask is that our allies and our partners and friends don’t do anything that would endanger our shared security interest,” Pompeo told reporters in The Hague on June 3. He did not mention chip equipment specifically.,The U.S. Department of State did not reply to a request for comment.,Six weeks later, during his visit to the White House, Rutte was given a copy of the intelligence report. Reuters could not determine whether U.S. President Donald Trump mentioned the ASML deal to Rutte during the White House meeting.,ASML’s export license expired unused on June 30, 2019, and no new license was granted in the following eight-week period during which a renewal request would normally be considered, according to a public database of licenses published by the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs.,Netherlands Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Irene Gerritsen said the Dutch government has sovereign discretion to grant licenses of dual-use technology and would not comment on specific cases.,With or without the EUV license, ASML expects its Chinese sales to increase in 2020 as it continues to ship earlier-generation equipment.,Reporting by Alexandra Alper in Washington, Toby Sterling in Amsterdam and Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Additional reporting by Humeyra Pamuk in Washington; Editing by Jonathan Weber and Bill Rigby,Our Standards: ,All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

			,This thing is loaded with lithium.,Scientists at Northwestern University and Argonne National Laboratory have shrunk room-sized neutron detector technology into a , powered by lithium semiconductors. Existing detectors “use helium gas or flashes of light,” which means the lithium technology makes a third family of detectors.,Lithium is a wild overachiever. It’s the lightest metal and , (the other elements are hydrogen and helium) that dates back to the beginning of the universe. Lithium salts are used to treat a variety of mental illnesses, and it’s hard to imagine life in 2020 without lithium-ion battery technology. The pure element itself is white, crumbly, and volatile, carefully stored in liquid like explosive feta cheese.,And it’s a powerful neutron attractor, which is the quality scientists have sought to isolate for years in order to make a new kind of neutron detector. In combination, the lithium attracts neutrons and the semiconductive activity allows an electrical “alert” to occur. The obstacle, for a long time, was to find a semiconductor that also contained lithium.,Mercouri Kanatzidis, who works for both Northwestern and Argonne, is leading the team that developed the new detector. He says researchers understood the idea of a lithium neutron detector but couldn’t quite find the right material to close the loop. “You can find good semiconductors, but they don’t have lithium. Or you can find stable lithium compounds that are not good semiconductors,” he ,.,Kanatzidis’s team combined lithium, indium, phosphorous, and selenium in a layered array of crystals. Lithium turns to dust when exposed to water, so the lithium is sealed within the crystal structure and protected from the elements.,




,“We anticipate that these results will spark interest in this field and enable the replacement of [helium-powered] counters by semiconductor-based neutron detectors,” the team concludes ,.,The new detector doesn’t just have lithium—it has a , of lithium, giving it a density of detection ability that means it can be effective at pocket size. Having such a portable option is a huge benefit for neutron detectors, which “are critical in many sectors, including national security, medicine, crystallography and astronomy,” the team writes. Crystallography is ,, and identifying neutrons can help scientists in turn identify what crystals are and how they form and work. Neutron detectors also help scientists measure the nuclear power and radiation output from reactors.,A much smaller detector could cost a lot less, require less infrastructure and installation, and be discreet for use by safety inspectors or security personnel. Kanatzidis says the variety of technologies itself is also important, because a detector the size of a truck is still useful for, well, ,, the same way you don’t want to vacuum your whole house with a Dust Buster. But having a neutron Dust Buster in your toolkit is a great option across a variety of research and commercial settings.",https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a30555289/lithium-neutron-detector/,semiconductor,UK,Popular Mechanics,Lithium - What Lithium Is Used For - Lithium Uses - Popular Mechanics

30 Jan 2020,"A research group at the HZDR Institute for Ion Beam Physics and Materials Research in Dresden has succeeded in producing encapsulated transistors based on indium selenide and gallium selenide. The encapsulation technique protects the sensitive layers from external influences and preserves their performance. The scientists use hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) for encapsulation. It is ideally suited for this purpose because it can be formed into a thin layer and is inert, i.e. it does not react with the environment,Indium and gallium selenide are considered promising candidates for advanced high-performance applications, for example in high-frequency electronics, optoelectronics or sensor technology. The materials can be used to form flake-like layers with a thickness of only 5 to 10 atomic layers, which in turn enable the production of electronic components with extremely small dimensions. The electrical conduction in these layers takes place only in a 2-dimensional plane.,In the new encapsulation method the two-dimensional flakes are arranged between two platelets of hexagonal boron nitride and thus completely enclosed. The upper hBN layer provides the insulation to the outside, the lower layer serves as a spacer to the carrier material. This technique was originally developed by a research group at Columbia University in New York, where scientist Himani Arora learned it during a research stay. Now, as a doctoral student at the International Helmholtz Research School (IHRS) NanoNet, she is further developing the technique at the HZDR., Video / Webinar Channel,All material on this site Copyright © 2017 European Business Press SA.

,The Philadelphia chip index soared 60% in 2019, despite a bottoming industry cycle. Industry sales are expected to rebound this year. (Dennis Nishi),Investors in semiconductor stocks could hardly be blamed if they headed into January feeling a fear of heights. The industry benchmark Philadelphia chip index surged 60% in 2019, its biggest gain in a decade. That led analysts to question valuations, with some predicting a slower-than-usual first quarter.,All agreed that more gains were in the offing — the question was when. Then, on Thursday, the semiconductor industry received a bolt of good news. , (,) — a leading provider of chip manufacturing services to , (,), , (,) and , (,) — reported its first earnings beat in three quarters and guided higher for the coming quarter. The bellwether company forecast higher investments in semiconductor capital equipment for the year, on the back of strengthening 5G wireless and high-performance computing.,That outlook fits the view of a number of analysts who contend that semiconductor stocks have room to run higher this year, even after their big run-up in 2019. One optimist is analyst C.J. Muse of Evercore ISI. Muse forecast in a Jan. 13 report that semiconductor industry revenue will rise 11% in 2020.,""Semiconductors are a secular growth story, on the cusp of true rising silicon intensity led by AI and Big Data (creation, transmission, analytics, storage) that will continue to drive the third meaningful upcycle for semiconductors,"" Muse said.,Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. , & ,In 2019, the Philadelphia semiconductor index, known as SOX, surged 60.1%, rebounding from a decline of 7.8% in 2018. It was the Philly chip index's best year since 2009, and well above the Nasdaq's 2019 gain of 35.2%. The S&P 500 rose 28.9% last year while the Dow climbed 22.3%.,AMD, , (,) and , (,) were just a few of the semiconductor stocks to lead that advance. The stocks rallied despite the cyclical decline in industry sales for the year. Now forecasts call for a rebound in the cycle, and for rising demand on the back of the 5G network rollout, recovering China trade and other trends — clearing a route for potential further gains.,Over the past week, Nvidia, , (,) and AMD all received stock upgrades or price-target hikes. Fourth-quarter consensus estimates see Nvidia and AMD posting powerful triple-digit earnings rebounds, and they call for ASML to turn around three quarters of earnings declines.,The chip industry has become critical to essentially all segments of the economy, providing the basic tools used to collect, move, store and organize data. Semiconductors are the basis upon which personal computers, servers, tablets, smartphones and many other devices depend. New chips are also enabling increasingly ""intelligent"" televisions, home appliances, automobiles and more. Plus, they power such ubertrends as the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence.,Semiconductor stocks turned south in late 2018 when demand slowed, especially for memory chips. The industry's supply/demand cycle led to a shortage of chips, forcing prices higher. But the stocks have surged recently on expectations for a rebound in sales as supply and demand even out and prices ease.,Still, Robert Maire, president of consulting firm Semiconductor Advisors, believes chip stocks may have gotten ahead of themselves.,""A lot of my stocks being up 50%-60% where the fundamentals were barely up or actually flat year over year is kind of surprising,"" Maire told Investor's Business Daily. ""Clearly, a lot of this is on anticipation."",Meanwhile, many analysts remain positive on,.,Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh upgraded AMD stock to buy from neutral. He says the 2020 server market is likely to outperform the current ""muted"" consensus expectations. AMD is set to continue whittling market share from industry giant , (,), and the gaming console cycle is expected to pick up in the second half of the year. Rakesh raised the stock's price target to 55, about 9% above where the stock traded on Tuesday.,Nvidia earned an 18% price-target hike, to 300, from Craig-Hallum on Jan. 13. Analyst Richard Shannon says data-center trends are accelerating, driven by conversational AI. He also expects stronger gaming demand in the second half of the year.,Semiconductor stocks showing strength lately are those that play in hot trends like the 5G wireless infrastructure buildout and smartphone upgrade cycle as well as the growth of cloud-computing data centers.,Chip stocks benefiting from fifth-generation cellular networks include Cirrus Logic, , (,) and , (,). Apple is seen coming out with 5G iPhones in the fall, boosting a host of chip suppliers.,In the data-center market, some major chip players include AMD, Inphi, Intel and Nvidia. , above a 59.23 buy point.,. The semiconductor manufacturers group on Friday ranked No. 8 out of 197 groups. Top-performing stocks in the group include , (,), , (,) and , (,), according to the ,.,Qorvo and Qualcomm are also in the chip manufacturers group. , on Friday traded in a buy range above a 90.46 early entry in a flat-base pattern.,The fabless semiconductor group ranks No. 9, up from No. 49 just six months ago. Leading stocks in the group are Inphi, , (,) and Nvidia. The top stock in the segment, , (,), is being acquired by Nvidia.,Nvidia and , are also in the group. Both are currently listed, along with Inphi, on , stock service.,The semiconductor equipment industry group ranks eighth, up from No. 38 in mid-2019. These companies provide the equipment and technologies that enable manufacturing of the microscopic-scale circuitry that drives the chip industry.,Top-ranked equipment manufacturers include , (,), , (,) and , (,). KLA is just below a cup buy point at 180.05. Leaderboard stock ASML is also in the chip equipment group.,Research firm Gartner said Tuesday that , fell 11.9% in 2019 to $418.3 billion. The memory-chip segment, which accounted for 26.7% of semiconductor sales, saw revenue drop 31.5% last year. Gartner expects the semiconductor market to return to growth in 2020.,Nomura Instinet analyst David Wong forecasts global semiconductor sales will rise 8% to $441 billion in 2020. FactSet consensus analyst estimates project that AMD will see earnings growth accelerate to 81% in 2020. Nvidia and ASML are both forecast to post earnings declines for 2019, but then 2020 earnings are expected to jump 31% at Nvidia and 42% at ASML.,But Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore says the pace of the semiconductor industry recovery may not match the optimism implied in the SOX index. He is forecasting a ""muted"" recovery.,""With estimates falling throughout 2019 yet stocks rising to near all-time highs, we find the stock setup relatively challenging heading into 2020, as a solid, and potentially optimistic, fundamental recovery already seems to be priced into stocks,"" Seymore said. ""We struggle to find reasons for further valuation expansion for the semiconductor group in 2020."",While most chip segments are seeing improved sales, the memory-chip market is still mired in a downtrend. , (,), a key maker of DRAM and Nand flash memory chips, signaled on its last earnings call that it expects the current quarter to be the bottom of the cycle.,But the semiconductor industry cycle isn't what it used to be, consultant Maire says, adding that the current down cycle wasn't as severe as past downturns.,As a result of consolidation and improved operations, chip cycles may no longer be ""feast or famine,"" Maire says.,""Look at Micron,"" he said. ""Historically, in past down cycles, they lost money. This time, they just made less money."", this cycle, Sumit Sadana, Micron executive vice president and chief business officer, told IBD.,""We talk about the new Micron,"" Sadana said. ""And we have had an opportunity to demonstrate through this tough environment that this is a fundamentally different company."",Sadana also points to the positive free cash flow reported in , for the fiscal first quarter.,""We had solid profitability in fiscal Q1 and our forecast in fiscal Q2 still has solid profitability, whereas in the lowest point of our 2016 cycle, Micron had $1.3 billion of negative free cash flow in a single quarter,"" he said. ""This fiscal Q1, we had positive free cash flow of $80 million."",Evercore's Muse believes the semiconductor industry is getting a valuation adjustment following the downturn. Semiconductor companies are seeing the benefit of deep competitive moats, higher barriers to entry, and rising silicon content in products ranging from smartphones to automobiles. Those factors support ""superior"" free cash flow margins, even during cyclical troughs, he says.,""The structurally improving quality of semiconductor companies shined through the recent inventory correction,"" he said.,For 2020, his ""top stock ideas"" include chipmakers , (,), Micron, Nvidia and , (,). He also likes chip equipment firms ASML, , (,), , (,) and Teradyne.,Marvell and Applied Materials traded near buy points on Friday.,The U.S.-China trade war hurt U.S. chipmakers as the Trump administration imposed export bans specifically on certain technology products. The supply hiccup may also have accelerated China's resolve to build its own chipmaking industry.,""China is working very hard to become independent of U.S. semiconductor manufacturers,"" Maire said.,""So, in the short term, there may not be a risk to sales to China,"" he said. But the longer run, over the next five or 10 years, could be a different story.,China is ""certainly more of a risk now that we've threatened the supply, and they're consumers of over 60% of semiconductors made on the planet,"" Maire said.,Still, China's investment in chipmaking capacity has been a boon to makers of semiconductor capital equipment such as ASML and KLA, he says.,""Close to half of KLA's semiconductor tools are going to China, and other companies are selling a quarter to a third of their tools to China,"" Maire said. ""China has a roughly $100 billion checkbook and they're using it to become independent in the semiconductor industry."",Semiconductor stocks got positive news Jan. 6 when , for the calendar fourth quarter.,The Chandler, Ariz.-based company noted broad-based strength across all major geographies and in the data-center, industrial and auto markets.,Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill says the semiconductor industry cycle appears to be bottoming.,""We believe the inventory correction across the semi cycle that began in Oct. 2018 is mostly over,"" Gill said in a Jan. 7 report.

Typically, the third quarter is the peak as chipmakers rush to make chips for products sold in the fourth quarter.,""So, the fact that stocks are flying when we're going into a seasonally weak period is even more intriguing,"" Maire said.,Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore turned cautious on semiconductor stocks on Dec. 18 following the sharp run-up in share values.,""We don't see much upside broadly and thus are selective in our overweights (buy ratings),"" he said. He believes Broadcom, Nvidia and NXP Semiconductors can outperform in 2020.,""Following a challenging 2019 dominated by weakening demand, inventory digestion and heightened trade tensions, we believe 2020 will see a return to growth even though headwinds still remain,"" Moore said. ""While inventory throughout the supply chain has come down slightly, it is still elevated by historical standards. Demand is improving but still remains challenged across key end markets, and trade uncertainty continues to hamper growth."",He added, ""While the worst is likely behind us, we see challenges persisting throughout first-half 2020 with the potential for a more robust recovery in the second half as the comps become easier and the excess gets worked through."",

	The technology sector is filled with names such as Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook that are readily familiar to consumers. Semiconductor companies, though, don’t enjoy those high profiles, perhaps because they do the grunt work behind the scenes making the chips and other components that serve as the nerve centers for a wide array of glitzy devices.
,
	“People think of semiconductors as less exciting companies in a plodding industry,” says Paul Wick, who has managed the Columbia Seligman Communications and Information fund for nearly 30 years. “But there are really a number of exciting stories in the sector.” Since 2012, the fund has allocated between 28.5% and 50% of its assets to semiconductors, according to Morningstar, well above the 11.4% to 15.9% allocation in the S&P North American Technology Sector Index over the same period.
,
	After a disappointing 2018, semiconductor stocks were among the market’s biggest winners in 2019. By mid-November, the SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF (XSD) had posted a total return, year to date, of 55%, more than double the return of the S&P 500 over the same period. With the tailwind of a significantly higher allocation to semiconductors and semiconductor equipment stocks than most of its tech peers have, Wick’s fund delivered a 45% return over the same period, beating the category competition by about 15 percentage points.                ,
	Despite the surge, he doesn’t think semiconductor stocks are in bubble territory. As a group, they still trade at less lofty valuations than broad market indexes, have better growth prospects than most companies and enjoy an increasingly diverse end user base that helps make them more resistant to recession. In the 1990s, personal computers accounted for 55% to 60% of global semiconductor industry revenue. Since then, semiconductors have found their way into everything from health-care devices to television sets and automobiles.,
	The companies in Wick’s portfolio also have strong intellectual property value and improving profit margins. They are enjoying firmed up prices and demand for their products, demand that had lagged in 2018 and the beginning of 2019. M&A has become more commonplace in the industry, and several of Wick’s portfolio companies have been acquired in the last couple of years. Still, he acknowledges, the sector could be hurt by the continuing threat of a trade war with China and the lingering uncertainty about U.S. semiconductor companies’ sales to Huawei, the Chinese telecom company.,
	,
	The fund’s strong resolve about semiconductor strength shows its willingness to chart a course different than its peers. Unlike many tech managers, Wick is wary of what he considers extremely high valuations and investment fads, both of which run rampant in the world of technology. He often invests less than most tech fund managers in some of the indexes’ most popular stocks, or doesn’t invest in them at all. His sector weightings can vary a lot from those of the benchmark.,
	With his focused portfolio of 50 to 65 stocks and his top 10 holdings representing 40% to 50% of assets, his performance skews toward a relatively narrow group. Mega caps with $100 billion or more in market capitalization account for only 29.32% of fund assets, while they represent 66.84% of the index. Small and mid-cap stocks with public values between $2 billion and $30 billion, on the other hand, are heavily overweight in the fund because they tend to be less risky than small caps but have better growth prospects than mega-cap companies. They are also more likely to be acquired, and they can be undervalued because they are less followed by investors and analysts.,
	While the fund owns a few popular industry titans, including Apple, Alphabet and Microsoft, these don’t occupy nearly as much space as they do in the index. Wick calls Apple, which has been in the fund since 2006, “a great franchise and best-of-breed company that’s been extremely profitable.” He likes its tendency to buy back stock, which helps profitability.,
	,
	Wick’s investment philosophy and distaste for overpaying for stocks began to take shape in 1987, when he began his career as a high-yield debt analyst at Seligman. He went on to manage the firm’s high-yield debt fund two years later, and then took over its equity technology fund after its manager left in 1989. “No one else wanted the job,” he recalls when asked why he made the transition from bonds to stocks. “It was a small fund and a big research headache.”,
	Within a few years, of course, the personal computer revolution would move technology stocks from the background to the forefront. Later, the internet revolution, the popularity of cell phones and widespread computerization would change the way people live and alter the investment landscape.,
	Through all of it, Wick never forgot that financial stability and price matter, even in the fast-paced world of tech stocks. “As a high-yield bond fund manager I had to pay attention to cash flow statements, balance sheets and profitability. That carried over when I went to the equity side,” he says.,Please log back in before proceeding.,There was an error logging in. Please try again.,Congrats! You are now logged in.

After a continuous interest in our ,, ,, and , market report from the industry stakeholders, we have tried to further expand our research scope to the semiconductor seals market. The report segments and analyses the market in the most detailed and comprehensive manner to provide a panoramic view of the market. The vital data/information provided in the report can play a crucial role for market participants as well as investors in the identification of low-hanging fruits available as well as formulate growth strategies.,The semiconductor manufacturing process is extremely critical and sensitive where contaminations are measured in microns. Semiconductor seals are used to avoid contaminations by reducing particulates, lowering extractable, and resisting degradation in harsh plasma. The general trend in the semiconductor fabrication industry is to reduce maintenance. To reduce the maintenance cost, fabricators are demanding high-performance seals with a better life span.,As per Stratview Research, ,. Several factors are driving the demand for seals in the semiconductor industry including increasing demand for semiconductors in high bandwidth smartphones, automotive, AI and IoT technologies and connected devices. Furthermore, there has been an increasing demand for high-performance seals for the manufacturing of 200mm to 300mm wafer sizes, reinforcing the demand for seals in the industry.,Based on the application type, the market is segmented into cleaning/etching, CVD, ALD, PVD, oxidation, diffusion, and others. ,. Rising demand for more efficient cleaning technologies for the development of efficient and effective semiconductors along with growth in the demand for cleaning/etching equipment owing to increasing demand for small devices such as smartphones, laptops and other consumer goods is driving the segment's market. CVD application is estimated to be the fastest-growing segment during the forecast period. Increasing investment towards development of thin-film solar photovoltaics and a surge in the demand for semiconductor lasers are driving the growth of CVD applications.,Based on material type, the market is segmented into FKM, FFKM, fluorosilicone, and others. ,. Increasing demand for high-performance seals in the wake of rising wafer size will continue to propel the demand for FFKM seals. FFKM is one of the most expensive elastomers, which founds usage in gaskets and o-rings as they can sustain harsh environments and high operating temperatures.,Based on the product type, ,. O-rings can be used in both static and dynamic applications where there is relative motion between the parts and O-ring. O-rings are required to sustain some of the harshest operating environments during the semiconductor production process, such as high heat, aggressive plasma, hot wet chemicals and amines, and remote NF3 cleans. These factors have led to an increased usage of FKM, FFKM, and fluorosilicone materials in the manufacturing of o-rings.,In terms of regions, ,. , is the manufacturing capital of the electrical & electronics industry, driven by many factors including low-cost manufacturing advantage, availability of raw materials, developed supply chain, and huge indigenous demand.

25 Jan 2020,"Scientists from University of California, Berkeley have created a blue light-emitting diode (LED) from a new semiconductor material – halide perovskite, overcoming a major barrier to employing these cheap, easy-to-make materials in electronic devices.,In the process, however, the researchers discovered a fundamental property of halide perovskites that may prove a barrier to their widespread use as solar cells and transistors.,Alternatively, this unique property may open up a whole new world for perovskites far beyond that of today’s standard semiconductors.,In a paper appearing Jan. 24 in the journal ,, UC Berkeley chemist Peidong Yang and his colleagues show that the crystal structure of the halide perovskites changes with temperature, humidity and the chemical environment, disrupting their optical and electronic properties. Without close control of the physical and chemical environment, perovskite devices are inherently unstable. This is not a major problem for traditional semiconductors.,“Some people may say this is a limitation. For me, this is a great opportunity,” said Yang, the S. K. and Angela Chan Distinguished Chair in Energy in the College of Chemistry and director of the Kavli Energy NanoSciences Institute. “This is new physics: a new class of semiconductors that can be readily reconfigured, depending on what sort of environment you put them in. They could be a really good sensor, maybe a really good photoconductor, because they will be very sensitive in their response to light and chemicals.”,Current semiconductors made of silicon or gallium nitride are very stable over a range of temperatures, primarily because their crystal structures are held together by strong covalent bonds. Halide perovskite crystals are held together by weaker ionic bonds, like those in a salt crystal. This means they’re easier to make, they can be evaporated out of a simple solution, but also susceptible to humidity, heat and other environmental conditions.,“This paper is not just about showing off that we made this blue LED,” said Yang, who is a senior faculty scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) and a UC Berkeley professor of materials science and engineering. “We are also telling people that we really need to pay attention to the structural evolution of perovskites during the device operation, any time you drive these perovskites with an electrical current, whether it is an LED, a solar cell or a transistor. This is an intrinsic property of this new class of semiconductor and affects any potential optoelectronic device in the future using this class of material.”,Making semiconductor diodes that emit blue light has always been a challenge, Yang said. The 2014 Nobel Prize for Physics was awarded for the breakthrough creation of efficient blue light-emitting diodes from gallium nitride. Diodes, which emit light when an electric current flows through them, are optoelectronic components in fiber optic circuits as well as general purpose LED lights.,Since halide perovskites first drew wide attention in 2009, when Japanese scientists discovered that they make highly efficient solar cells, these easily made, inexpensive crystals have excited researchers. So far, red and green-emitting diodes have been demonstrated, but not blue. Halide perovskite blue-emitting diodes have been unstable — that is, their color shifts to longer, redder wavelengths with use.,As Yang and his colleagues discovered, this is due to the unique nature of perovskites’ crystal structure. Halide perovskites are composed of a metal, such as lead or tin, equal numbers of larger atoms, such as cesium, and three times the number of halide atoms, such as chlorine, bromine or iodine.,When these elements are mixed together in solution and then dried, the atoms assemble into a crystal, just as salt crystalizes from sea water. Using a new technique and the ingredients cesium, lead and bromine, the UC Berkeley and Berkeley Lab chemists created perovskite crystals that emit blue light and then bombarded them with X-rays at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) to determine their crystalline structure at various temperatures. They found that, when heated from room temperature (about 300 Kelvin) to around 450 Kelvin, a common operating temperature for semiconductors, the crystal’s squashed structure expanded and eventually sprang into a new orthorhombic or tetragonal configuration.,Since the light emitted by these crystals depends on the arrangement of and distances between atoms, the color changed with temperature, as well. A perovskite crystal that emitted blue light (450 nanometers wavelength) at 300 Kelvin suddenly emitted blue-green light at 450 Kelvin.,Yang attributes perovskites’ flexible crystal structure to the weaker ionic bonds typical of halide atoms. Naturally occurring mineral perovskite incorporates oxygen instead of halides, producing a very stable mineral. Silicon-based and gallium nitride semiconductors are similarly stable because the atoms are linked by strong covalent bonds.,According to Yang, blue-emitting perovskite diodes have been hard to create because the standard technique of growing the crystals as a thin film encourages formation of mixed crystal structures, each of which emits at a different wavelength. Electrons get funneled down to those crystals with the smallest bandgap, that is, the smallest range of unallowed energies, before emitting light, which tends to be red.,To avoid this, Yang’s postdoctoral fellows and co-first authors, Hong Chen, Jia Lin and Joohoon Kang, grew single, layered crystals of perovskite and, adapting a low-tech method for creating graphene, used tape to peel off a single layer of uniform perovskite. When incorporated into a circuit and zapped with electricity, the perovskite glowed blue. The actual blue wavelength varied with the number of layers of octahedral perovskite crystals, which are separated from one another by a layer of organic molecules that allows easy separation of perovskite layers and also protects the surface.,Nevertheless, the SLAC experiments showed that the blue-emitting perovskites changed their emission colors with temperature. This property can have interesting applications, Yang said. Two years ago, he demonstrated a window made of halide perovskite that becomes dark in the sun and transparent when the sun goes down and also produces photovoltaic energy.,“We need to think in different ways of using this class of semiconductor,” he said. “We should not put halide , into the same application environment as a traditional covalent semiconductor, like silicon. We need to realize that this class of material has intrinsic structural properties that make it ready to reconfigure. We should utilize that.”,The work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Basic Energy Sciences program.
