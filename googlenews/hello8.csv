16 Jan 2020," for Robert Harris’s thriller, “Enigma”, is wartime Britain, where everything is rationed except for the rain. It follows Tom Jericho, a young prodigy stationed at Bletchley Park, the real-life centre of code-breaking operations, who is part of a team of cryptologists trying to break the code used by Germany’s armed forces. The work has frustration built in. Any progress can be undone if the enemy changes the code—which he will if he suspects that it has been cracked.",https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2020/01/16/what-the-semiconductor-industry-tells-us-about-the-world-economy,semiconductor,UK,The Economist,What the semiconductor industry tells us about the world economy - The Economist
