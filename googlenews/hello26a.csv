semiconductor,china,"New Semiconductor Technologies Driving Down Cost Of Electric Vehicle 
Batteries","Until now, electric vehicle batteries suffered from being costly, large and inefficient. Gallium nitride (GaN) and silicon carbide (SiC) are two semiconductor technologies in the driver’s seat to change all that. ,The newer chemistries allow for smaller, more efficient semiconductors that can operate at higher voltages than traditional silicon wafers. Tesla’s decision to include SiC transistors in its Model 3 was seen as a big milestone for the industry. ,With the automotive industry’s rapid pivot to electric vehicles, a slew of semiconductor startups are expected to be targeted by more-established players.,Leading power semiconductor device players, which feature STMicroelectronics, Infineon Technologies, ON Semiconductor and Mitsubishi Electric, likely are all watching the upstarts. Some have already made acquisitions, as STMicro did in February 2019 when it bought Swedish SiC wafer manufacturer Norstel for $137.5 million. Other big players – such as Panasonic, ON Semiconductor, Texas Instruments and SanKen Electric – also have been developing GaN switching transistors. Expect some to switch gears with an acquisition to speed up that process, according to an industry investment banker and analyst.

semiconductor,china,Chipmaker TSMC says ready for potential new US export controls,"Since the US barred Huawei from buying US supplies last year, TSMC has emerged as the main guarantor for the Chinese company’s continued access to the high-end semiconductors Chinese manufacturers cannot produce themselves. This is possible because US export control rules allow shipments of products that contain less than 25 per cent of US-made content to continue. ,The Trump administration is considering tightening the US content threshold from 25 to 10 per cent. Another proposal that could have more wide-ranging fallout would be including US-made semiconductor manufacturing equipment in the calculation of US components. Since such machinery is very expensive, industry experts believe those changes would spell an end to supplies to Huawei altogether. ,TSMC said it would spend up to $16bn this year on capital investment, up from $14.9bn in 2019. The company expects the ramp-up of 5G telecom services to drive a strong recovery in the semiconductor market. ,TSMC expects the total semiconductor market to grow by 8 per cent and the foundry segment by 17 per cent. “We are confident that we can outgrow foundry by several percentage points,” said chief executive CC Wei. Revenue in the first quarter is forecast to be flat at $10.2bn to $10.3bn.,The company reported a 9.5 per cent increase in revenue and a 16 per cent jump in net income year on year for the fourth quarter of 2019, driven by demand for the semiconductors that power new smartphones. ",2020-1-15,Financial Times,https://www.ft.com/content/0be9ed74-3825-11ea-a6d3-9a26f8c3cba4
semiconductor,china,South Korea no rival to Taiwan in semiconductor industry ...,"
            TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — South Korea can hardly compete with Taiwan in semiconductor manufacturing despite the ambitious move by Samsung Electronics to put a 3-nanometer semiconductor node into commercial production, said Taiwan’s top tech official.,
            Taiwan’s semiconductor industry had an annual output valued at NT$2.6 trillion (US$867 billion) in 2019, said Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) Minister Chen Liang-gee (陳良基) at a news conference held on Monday (Jan. 20). The output is expected to double to NT$5.2 trillion within a decade and even reach NT$6 trillion by 2030 according to an optimistic forecast, wrote UDN.,
            While Samsung is striving to stay ahead of the game through the advancement of chip-making technology with strong backing from the South Korean government, it is unlikely to beat Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the world’s largest semiconductor foundry, Chen believes.,
            Taiwan’s semiconductor businesses thrive on cluster development and an “industry ecology,” as evidenced by the country's many science parks, Chen said. This provides an unrivaled competitive edge for local companies, even faced with competition from Samsung, a conglomerate which receives enormous resources from the government.,
            The island country also boasts top-notch semiconductor packaging, assembly, and testing technology which, along with heterogeneous integration and advanced process control technologies, will receive equal emphasis as Taiwan endeavors to cement its commanding position on the world’s chip manufacturing scene, Chen reckoned.,
            The establishment of a research and development center for the semiconductor sector is in the pipeline, said Chen, as part of a national strategy to promote the technology that serves as a pillar of Taiwan’s economy, wrote UDN.",2020-1-21,Taiwan News,https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3861646

semiconductor,china,Intel retook semiconductor top spot from Samsung in 2019,"Worldwide semiconductor revenue declined 12% in 2019, Gartner says.,Intel has reclaimed the top spot in the semiconductor market from Samsung in 2019, research firm Gartner has said.    Worldwide revenue for semiconductors, however, was only around $418 billion -- a decline of 12% from 2018, it said.      Intel was top in 2019 revenue at around $65.8 billion, followed by Samsung's $52.2 billion. SK Hynix and Micron earned $22.4 billion and $20 billion for semiconductors, respectively, taking third and fourth place.      Samsung had become the top vendor in worldwide semiconductor revenue for the first time in 2017, and again in 2018, thanks to unprecedented demand for memory chips which helped it clinch record profits during the third quarter of 2018.     But the memory market began to face a downturn from the fourth quarter of 2018 onwards, which saw the South Korean tech giant's annual operating profits for 2019 drop by 53% from the previous year. Out of Samsung's various business, its memory business has experienced the steepest fall during this period.     ""The memory market, which accounted for 26.7% of semiconductor sales in 2019, experienced a 31.5% decline in revenue in 2019,"" said Andrew Norwood, Gartner's research vice president.      ""Within memory, DRAM revenue declined 37.5% due to an oversupply that started at the end of 2018 and lasted throughout 2019. The oversupply was caused by a sudden fall in demand from the hyperscale market. This revealed excessive OEM inventory levels that took the first half of the year to correct. Excessive inventory at DRAM vendors in the second half of 2019 pushed pricing lower and resulted in an average selling price (ASP) decline of 47.4% in 2019,"" he added.      Though Intel did reclaim the top spot, it also saw revenue decline of around 1% in 2019 compared to the year prior. Constrained CPU supply and the sale of its modem business to Apple were also reasons for the slight revenue decline, Gartner noted.      Meanwhile, other semiconductor companies focused on memory saw drastic declines in their revenue: Samsung fell 29% from 2018, SK Hynix dropped 38%, and Micron 33%.      ""In 2020, we expect to see semiconductor market revenue increase after the high inventory clearance to drive up the chip ASP, especially in the memory sector,"" said Norwood.       ""The US-China trade war seems to be easing as we move into 2020. However, during 2019, the US added several Chinese companies, including Huawei, to the Entity List restricting the sale of US components. The immediate impact was to push Huawei into looking outside the US for alternative silicon suppliers, with wholly-owned HiSilicon at the top of the list as well as alternative suppliers based in Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, and China. This will be an area to watch in 2020,"" he added.  ,Delivering mixed third quarter results, Broadcom CEO Hock Tan said the company expects semiconductor demand to remain at current levels ""due to the uncertain environment.""
