TSMC, as a major U.S. and Chinese chip supplier, has often found itself in the middle of the technology standoff as a result.

Innovators and engineers from both sides will co-develop space-based photovoltaic cells with a more efficient, low-cost, robust silicon wafer as the supporting bottom substrate and bottom cell.
Taking advantage of using inexpensive silicon wafers, the high-efficiency solar technology is easy to manufacture at large scale but can achieve a higher solar energy conversion rate.
Also, as well as having the much lower degradation required for next-generation solar cells in space, it also has a more robust and rugged design.

BES’ in-house multidisciplinary team worked closely with Catapult’s technical project leads to develop a design for the technical facilities that answer the current and future goals of the CSA Catapult Innovation Centre’s remit.
CEO of CSA Catapult, Stephen Doran, said: “CSA Catapult will play a crucial part in the global adoption of compound semiconductor technology, and the work that BES has completed for us will help us on that journey.”",20/1/2020,Cleanroom Technology,https://www.cleanroomtechnology.com/news/article_page/BES_completes_10m_semiconductor_facility_for_CSA_Catapult/161592

Although the names of a star and an exoplanet submitted by Taiwanese astronomers were recognized, their country was listed as ""China Taipei.""
Taiwanese astronomers sorted through over 120 suggestions before selecting ""Formosa"" for HD 100655b and ""Sazum"" for its exoplanet.
As both countries at the time insisted on using ""China"" in their names, the IAU in 1979 came up with the odd compromise of listing Taiwan as ""China Taipei"" and Communist China as ""China Nanjing.""

In a research note Friday, the U.S. securities house said it was pleased by TSMC's sales forecast for 2020 and was therefore raising its target price on the stock from NT$396 to NT$402.It was the first foreign brokerage to give a target price of more than NT$400 on shares of TSMC, the world's largest chipmaker.
Citing optimism toward the growth of TSMC, the American brokerage kept its ""buy"" rating on TSMC shares.Meanwhile, a Japanese securities house also maintained its ""buy"" recommendation on the stock and its target price of NT$395.
A European brokerage, which kept its target price of NT$375 and its ""outperform"" rating on TSMC shares, forecast the company's 2020 sales at between US$3 billion and US$3.5 billion, driven by sales of iPhones and Android smartphones for which TSMC makes chips.
On Friday, TSMC shares fell 0.45 percent to close at NT$333.00 on the Taiwan Stock Exchange, which market analysts attributed to cautious sentiment on the broader market before the seven-day Lunar New Year holiday and worry over the effects of increased U.S. sanctions against Huawei",19/1/2020,Taiwan News,https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3860101
