semiconductor,US,U.S. chip foundry announces new manufacturing plant in Singapore,"Michaela Rehle | ReutersSINGAPORE — U.S.-headquartered semiconductor manufacturer GlobalFoundries announced Tuesday that it will build a new fabrication plant in Singapore to meet the unprecedented global demand for chips.
The new facility will be developed in partnership with the Singapore Economic Development Board and with co-investments from committed customers, GlobalFoundries said.
A global shortage of semiconductor microchips is causing havoc, delaying car production and affecting operations at some of the largest consumer electronics manufacturers.
A virtual groundbreaking ceremony for the plant was attended by Singapore's Transport Minister S Iswaran as well as Mubadala Investment Company Managing Director and Group CEO Khaldoon Khalifa Al Mubarak, among others.

semiconductor,US,GlobalFoundries puts $4bn into Singapore expansion,"SINGAPORE -- U.S. semiconductor giant GlobalFoundries will invest over $4 billion to expand its Singapore wafer plant and ramp up capacity as it attempts to tackle the global microchip shortage.
When fully operational by 2024, the expansion is expected to boost GlobalFoundries' capacity to about 1.5 million wafers per year.
Given that GlobalFoundries' manufacturing activities are spread across Asia, Europe and North America, the CEO said his company's worldwide footprint provides ""supply chain security balance.""
Amid the global semiconductor shortage, GlobalFoundries projects that supply could lag behind demand until 2022 or later, with the rapidly increasing clamor for chips ""accelerated immensely"" by COVID.

semiconductor,US,U.S. senators propose 25% tax credit for semiconductor ...,"REUTERS/Steve Marcus/File PhotoWASHINGTON, June 17 (Reuters) - A bipartisan group of U.S. senators on Thursday proposed a 25% tax credit for investments in semiconductor manufacturing as Congress works to increase U.S. chip production.
The group did not immediately provide a cost estimate for the measure, which is on top of recent proposed semiconductor funding.
Last week, the Senate approved $52 billion for production and research on semiconductors and telecommunications equipment.
Raimondo anticipates government funding would generate ""$150 billion-plus"" in investment in chip production and research - including contributions from state and federal governments and private-sector firms.
The tax credit could benefit Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC)  , which is building a $12 billion semiconductor factory in Arizona, and Dutch chipmaker NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI.O) as well as U.S. firms such as Intel Corp (INTC.O) and Micron Technology Inc (MU.O)",2021-6-17,Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-senators-propose-new-25-tax-credit-semiconductor-manufacturing-2021-06-17/

In January, Congress enacted the CHIPS for America Act as part of the fiscal 2021 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which authorizes incentives for domestic semiconductor manufacturing and investments in chip research.
Since then, industry groups, including the Semiconductor Industry Association, have called on leaders in Congress to enact an investment tax credit, such as the measures included in the legislation introduced on Thursday.

The ongoing chip shortage, which has hit automakers, electronics makers and more, has also pushed the government to reinvigorate domestic chip manufacturing.
Along with the shift of chip manufacturing to Asia over the past decades, the number of graduates related to chip engineering in the U.S. has diminished.
To address this issue, Intel has been investing in education along with the Arizona state government.
