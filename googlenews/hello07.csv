semiconductor,china,Technological progress in China could still lead to fireworks,"Behind their legitimate concerns that China has stolen IP and that some of its companies cheat, American politicians worry that China’s approach to technological development can produce results which America’s mostly market-led model cannot.
In China the alignment between government policy and corporate technology development can be seen in the shift towards electric vehicles, largely to cut air pollution.
Published research, patents, people, contracts, supply chains and technical standards all link Chinese technology to that which underpins all the other advanced economies—and vice versa.
